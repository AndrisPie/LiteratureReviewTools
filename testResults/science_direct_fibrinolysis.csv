Structure–activity relationship of cyclic pentapeptide malformins as fibrinolysis enhancers,"{'author': [{'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Koizumi', 'given-name': 'Yukio'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Nagai', 'given-name': 'Kenichiro'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Hasumi', 'given-name': 'Keiji'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kuba', 'given-name': 'Keiji'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sugiyama', 'given-name': 'Toshihiro'}]}",1 November 2016,http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960894X16309866,1-s2.0-S0960894X16309866,"AbstractThe formation of blood clots in blood vessels causes severe ischemic diseases such as cerebral infarction and myocardial infarction. While searching for microbial products that increase fibrinolytic activity using an in vitro fibrin degradation assay, we found malformin A1, a disulfide form of cyclo(–d-Cys-d-Cys-l-Val-d-Leu-l-Ile–), as an active compound. In this study, we synthesized malformin derivatives using a solid-phase peptide synthesis method and evaluated their fibrinolytic activity and cytotoxicity. Reduction of the disulfide bond and linearization of the cyclic peptide frame decreased the pro-fibrinolytic activity. Substitution of a branched-chain amino acid with lysine resulted in loss of activity. However, protection of the amino group in the lysine derivatives by the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group rescued the inactivity. Furthermore, the phenylalanine derivatives also exhibited a similar pro-fibrinolytic effect compared to malformin A1. These results suggest that the disulfide bond, the cyclic peptide frame, and the bulky hydrophobic side chains play a crucial role in the pro-fibrinolytic activity of malformin. The effective dose of the active derivatives for the in vitro fibrin degradation showed similar ranges (1–5μM), while the order of cytotoxic potency for the active derivatives was as follows: Phe-derivatives&gt;BocLys-derivatives&gt;malformin A1&gt;reduced form. These results showed no correlation between pro-fibrinolytic activity and cytotoxicity, suggesting the possibility of the synthesis for non-toxic malformin derivatives possessing the activity."
Stimulation of thrombin- and plasmin-mediated activation of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor by anionic molecules,"{'author': [{'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Plug', 'given-name': 'Tom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Meijers', 'given-name': 'Joost C.M.'}]}",October 2016,http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384816305151,1-s2.0-S0049384816305151,"AbstractBackgroundThrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is a proenzyme that, once activated, attenuates fibrinolysis by removing C-terminal lysine residues from partially degraded fibrin. TAFI can be activated by thrombin or plasmin via a cleavage at Arg92 that removes the activation peptide from the enzyme, TAFIa. Thrombomodulin enhances thrombin-mediated TAFI activation and glycosaminoglycans enhance plasmin-mediated TAFI activation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there are other anionic molecules that function as a cofactor for thrombin- or plasmin-mediated TAFI activation.MethodsTAFI activation by thrombin or plasmin was studied in the presence of physiological anionic molecules (polyphosphate, heparin, hyaluronan, DNA and dermatan sulfate) and the non-physiological sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Additionally, the effect of these molecules on TAFIa stability and on thrombin-mediated protein C activation was determined.ResultsUnfractioned heparin, calcium-saturated polyphosphate with an average chain length of 100 monomers (Ca-PolyP100) and SDS significantly enhanced TAFI activation by thrombin and plasmin. Dermatan sulfate and polyphosphates with sodium as counter ion (Na-PolyP700, Na-PolyP100 and Na-PolyP70) enhanced plasmin-mediated but not thrombin-mediated TAFI activation. Additionally, unfractioned heparin, Ca-PolyP100 and SDS enhanced thrombin-mediated protein C activation. The different nature of anionic molecules capable of enhancing TAFI and protein C activation suggests a general mechanism.ConclusionsSeveral anionic molecules function as (potent) cofactors for thrombin- and plasmin-mediated TAFI activation and thrombin-mediated protein C activation. This may imply that thrombin and plasmin activity is regulated in the vasculature by more cofactors than currently appreciated."
Dysfunctional coagulation and fibrinolysis systems due to adenomyosis is a possible cause of thrombosis and menorrhagia,"{'author': [{'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Yamanaka', 'given-name': 'Akiyoshi'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kimura', 'given-name': 'Fuminori'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Yoshida', 'given-name': 'Takashi'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kita', 'given-name': 'Nobuyuki'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Takahashi', 'given-name': 'Kentaro'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kushima', 'given-name': 'Ryoji'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Murakmai', 'given-name': 'Takashi'}]}",September 2016,http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301211516308260,1-s2.0-S0301211516308260,"AbstractObjectiveTo study the effects of adenomyosis on the coagulation and fibrinolysis system during menstruation and the relationship between dysfunction of the coagulation and fibrinolysis system and the symptoms and complications of adenomyosis.Study designConcentrations of thrombin–antithrombin complex (TAT) and soluble fibrin (SF) as markers of coagulation, D-dimer (DD) as a marker of both coagulation and fibrinolysis, and plasmin-alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC) as a marker of fibrinolysis in the peripheral blood of eight patients with adenomyosis were measured daily from the first to fifth day of menstruation. Associations between levels of these markers during menstruation and patient characteristics, history of thrombotic disorder, and hemoglobin loss during menstruation were investigated.ResultsTAT, SF, DD and PIC increased in 5, 2, 3 and 1 of the 8 patients, respectively. TAT increased in 5 of the 6 patients with an adenomyotic uterus ≥100 cubic centimeters. Patients with elevated DD, SF and/or PIC were among patients with elevated TAT. DD was only increased in 3 patients with a past history of small cerebral infarction or pulmonary thromboembolism and/or hemoglobin loss &gt;2.0g/dl during menstruation. SF was increased only in 2 patients with a past history of cerebral infarction or pulmonary thromboembolism. PIC increased in 1 of the 2 patients with hemoglobin loss &gt;2.0g/dl during menstruation.ConclusionAdenomyosis patients with a uterus volume ≥100 cubic centimeters are at risk of having an activated coagulation system. These patients, particularly those with elevated SF and DD, may be at risk of thrombotic disorders. Fibrinolysis is activated in a portion of patients with activated coagulation during menstruation. Activated fibrinolysis during menstruation may contribute to menorrhagia in patients with adenomyosis, as only patients with activated fibrinolysis suffered menorrhagia, even though patients with an adenomyotic uterus ≥100 cubic centimeters without activated fibrinolysis did not. These results suggest extensive adenomyosis confers a potential risk of infarction and thrombosis and exacerbates menorrhagia via activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis during menstruation."
Fibrin clot formation and fibrinolysis in patients with a history of coronary stent thrombosis,"{'author': [{'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Godschalk', 'given-name': 'Thea C.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Konings', 'given-name': 'Joke'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Govers-Riemslag', 'given-name': 'José W.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'ten Berg', 'given-name': 'Jurriën M.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Hackeng', 'given-name': 'Christian M.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'ten Cate', 'given-name': 'Hugo'}]}",July 2016,http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384816303280,1-s2.0-S0049384816303280,"AbstractIntroductionCoronary stent thrombosis is a devastating complication of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Multiple factors underlie the pathophysiological mechanisms of stent thrombosis. Previous studies demonstrated that patients with stent thrombosis, compared to control PCI patients, formed denser fibrin clots in vitro which were more resistant to fibrinolysis, suggesting that altered fibrin clot properties may contribute to the pathophysiology of stent thrombosis. We assessed the plasma fibrin clot formation and fibrinolysis of patients with and without stent thrombosis.MethodsCases (patients with stent thrombosis) and matched controls (patients without stent thrombosis) were included for a matched case-control study. Matching was performed on indication and time of the index PCI (initial stent implantation) from the cases. Fibrin clot formation and fibrinolysis were assessed in vitro by turbidimetric assays, with human thrombin to initiate fibrin polymerization and tissue type plasminogen activator to initiate fibrinolysis. Lag time, maximal absorbance and clot lysis time were determined by these assays.ResultsIn total, 27 cases and 27 controls were included. No significant differences were observed between cases and controls in lag time (173 vs. 162s, p=0.18), maximal absorbance (0.78 vs. 0.83, p=0.36), and clot lysis time (69 vs. 71min, p=0.78). Fibrin clot formation and fibrinolysis were not associated with stent thrombosis.ConclusionsPlasma fibrin clot formation and fibrinolysis were not significantly different between patients with stent thrombosis and matched control patients, suggesting that fibrin clot formation and fibrinolysis play no significant role in the pathophysiology of stent thrombosis."
Bidirectional functions of thrombin on fibrinolysis: Evidence of thrombin-dependent enhancement of fibrinolysis provided by spontaneous plasma clot lysis,"{'author': [{'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Tomczyk', 'given-name': 'Martyna'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Suzuki', 'given-name': 'Yuko'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sano', 'given-name': 'Hideto'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Brzoska', 'given-name': 'Tomasz'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Tanaka', 'given-name': 'Hiroki'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Urano', 'given-name': 'Tetsumei'}]}",July 2016,http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384816303164,1-s2.0-S0049384816303164,"AbstractBesides procoagulant activity, thrombin exhibits anticoagulant and profibrinolytic activities. We demonstrated that the euglobulin clot lysis time (ECLT) was shortened by endogenously generated thrombin as a result of the inactivation of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). In contrast, thrombin suppressed fibrinolytic activity through the activation of thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI). Here, using three different clot lysis assays of the ECLT, the tissue plasminogen activator supplemented plasma clot lysis time (tPA-PCLT) and the spontaneous plasma clot lysis time (s-PCLT), we analyzed how the coagulation process modifies fibrinolysis. The ECLT was shortened by exogenously supplemented thrombin in a dose-dependent manner in the absence of calcium ion (Ca++), whereas this shortening was not observed in the presence of Ca++ where endogenous prothrombin was effectively activated to thrombin. This shortening was also not observed for the tPA-PCLT, in which tPA is supplemented in excess and PAI-1 activity is mostly lost. On the contrary, thrombin dose-dependently prolonged the tPA-PCLT, which was mostly abolished by inhibitors of carboxypeptidase and activated FXIII, suggesting that the prolongation is TAFI- and Factor XIII-dependent. The s-PCLT was shortened when thrombin generation was boosted by supplementing tissue factor and phosphatidylserine together with Ca++, which was more apparent in the presence of inhibitors of activated FXIII and activated TAFI. Thus, thrombin appeared to express its enhancing effect on fibrinolysis even in plasma, in addition to its inhibiting effect. These bidirectional functions of thrombin on fibrinolysis seem to take place on demand under different environments to maintain adequate vascular blood flow."

To explore the potential mechanisms, we investigated the effects of RIC on coagulation and fibrinolysis.MethodsInterventional crossover study including 30 healthy drug-naïve males. Participants were exposed to a sham intervention (visit 1) and to RIC (visit 2 and 3) induced by intermittent arm ischaemia through four cycles of 5-min inflation of a blood pressure cuff followed by 5-min deflation. Prior to visit 3, all participants received aspirin 75mg daily for seven days. Blood samples were obtained at baseline as well as 5 and 45min after intervention. Whole blood coagulation was assessed by thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) and thrombin generation. Fibrinolysis was evaluated by clot turbidity-lysis, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1).ResultsNo differences were found in clot initiation, clot propagation or clot strength evaluated by ROTEM® (all p-values≥0.98). During aspirin treatment, clot initiation and clot propagation decreased after RIC evaluated by ROTEM® EXTEM® clotting time (p=0.04) and ROTEM® EXTEM® maximum velocity (p=0.03). After sham and RIC, thrombin generation declined as evaluated by reduced endogenous thrombin potential (RIC: p=0.001) and peak (RIC: p=0.01). After RIC during aspirin treatment, changes in thrombin generation were inconsistent; increased peak (p=0.04) and time to peak (p&lt;0.001) and a decrease in lag-time (p&lt;0.001).Clot lysis time was prolonged both after sham and after RIC (p&lt;0.001). After RIC, PAI-1 levels declined (p=0.03), but t-PA levels also declined after all interventions (p-values≤0.04).Conclusion.RIC did not have substantial effects on coagulation or fibrinolysis compared to sham. Overall, aspirin did not influence the results."
Synergistic fibrinolysis: The combined effects of tissue plasminogen activator and recombinant staphylokinase in vitro,"{'author': [{'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Aisina', 'given-name': 'Roza'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Mukhametova', 'given-name': 'Liliya'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Varfolomeyev', 'given-name': 'Sergei'}]}",April 2016,http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S030441651500361X,1-s2.0-S030441651500361X,"AbstractBackgroundMechanisms of fibrin-specificity of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and recombinant staphylokinase (STA) are different, therefore we studied in vitro the possibility of the synergy of their combined thrombolytic action.MethodsThrombolytic effects of tPA, STA and their combinations were measured by lysis rate of human plasma clot and side effects were evaluated by decreasing in fibrinogen, plasminogen and α2-antiplasmin levels in the surrounding plasma at 37°C in vitro.ResultsSTA and tPA induced dose- and time-dependent clot lysis: 50% lysis in 2h was obtained with 30nM tPA and 75nM STA, respectively. At these concentrations, tPA produced greater degradation of plasma fibrinogen than STA. According to a mathematical analysis of dose–response curves by the isobole method, combinations of tPA and STA caused a considerable synergistic thrombolytic effect. The simultaneous and sequential combinations of tPA (&lt;4nM) and STA (&lt;35nM) induced a significant fibrin-specific synergistic thrombolysis, which was more pronounced in 2h at simultaneous combinations than at sequential addition of STA after 30min of tPA action. Simultaneous combination of 2.5nM tPA and 15nM STA showed a maximal 3-fold increase in thrombolytic effect compared to the expected total effect of the individual agents. Sequential combinations caused a lower depletion of plasma proteins compared to simultaneous combinations.ConclusionsThe simultaneous and sequential combinations of tPA and STA possessed synergistic fibrin-specific thrombolytic action on clot lysis in vitro.General significanceThe results show that combined thrombolysis may be more effective and safer than thrombolysis with each activator alone."

It was found that ONOO− (25–300µM) accelerated lysis of platelet-fibrin clots (in PRP) dose-dependently, whereas fibrinolysis of platelet-free clots was slightly inhibited by ≥1000µM stressor. Concentrations of ONOO− affecting the lysis of platelet-rich clots, inhibited clot retraction (CR) in a dose-dependent manner. Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) measurements performed in PRP showed that treatment with ONOO− (threshold conc. 100µM) prolongs clotting time, and reduces alpha angle, and clot formation velocity parameters indicating for reduced thrombin formation rate. In PRP, ONOO− (threshold conc. 100µM) reduced the collagen-evoked exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on platelets’ plasma membrane, the shedding of platelet-derived microparticles (PMP), and inhibited platelet-dependent thrombin generation (measured in artificial system), dose-dependently. As judged by confocal microscopy, similar ONOO− concentrations altered the architecture of clots formed in collagen-treated PRP. Clots formed in the presence of ONOO− were less dense and were composed of thicker fibers, which make them more susceptible to lysis. In platelet-depleted plasma, ONOO− (up to milimolar concentration) did not alter clot structure. Blockage of PS exposed on platelets resulted in an alteration of clot architecture toward more prone to lysis. ONOO−, at lysis-affecting concentrations, inhibited the collagen-evoked secretion of fibrinolytic inhibitors from platelets. We conclude that physiologically relevant ONOO− concentrations may accelerate the lysis of platelet-fibrin clots predominantly via downregulation of platelet-related mechanisms including: platelet secretion, clot retraction, platelet procoagulant response, and the alteration in clot architecture associated with it."

Conversely, proteins of the contact system and the fibrinolytic system show a high degree of homology and α-FXIIa can convert plasminogen into plasmin resulting in fibrin degradation. Therefore, we studied the contribution of α-FXIIa to overall clot stability and plasmin driven fibrinolysis in the absence and presence of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).We observed that α-FXIIa directly converted plasminogen into plasmin and reduced clot lysis time at all tPA concentrations tested (15–1500 pM). Simultaneous assessment of plasmin generation (chromogenic substrate S-2251) and fibrin formation and degradation (absorbance at 405nm), showed an earlier onset of fibrinolysis and plasmin formation in the presence of α-FXIIa. Fibrinolysis of clots formed under flow conditions, revealed that incorporation of α-FXIIa accelerated clot breakdown (fluorescence release of labeled fibrin) by additional plasmin generation on top of formation by tPA. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the surface area pore size increased in the presence compared with the absence of α-FXIIa when fibrinolysis was initiated by the conversion of plasminogen with tPA during clot formation.α-FXIIa enhances fibrinolysis in the presence of plasminogen, irrespective of whether tPA was present during clot formation or was added afterwards to initiate fibrinolysis. We postulate that FXIIa first strengthens the clot structure during clot formation and thereafter contributes towards fibrinolysis."

We evaluated clinical effectiveness of in situ fibrinolysis with original angiographic scores describing the aspect of carotid siphon, proximal ophthalmic artery, and choroid blush.MethodsRetrospective study of 16 consecutive cases of CRAO between 2007 and 2013. Fourteen underwent in situ fibrinolysis, two were excluded due to pre-occlusive internal carotid stenosis on pre-procedural diagnostic angio-CT. Fibrinolysis was performed with rt-PA (average injected dose: 35mg), with an average onset delay of 8hours (4–17h). We reported angiographic scores pre- and post-fibrinolysis, visual acuity (VA) before and after treatment, and VA improvement evaluated by ophthalmologist 6 to 12 months after thrombolysis.ResultsSix patients (43%) recovered post-fibrinolysis VA significally improved, superior or equal to 1/10 (1/10 to 8/10). An irregular carotid siphon (2 cases) appeared as a predictive factor of failure. Fibrinolysis procedure led to a significant improvement of angiographic permeability of proximal ophthalmic artery (P=0.0498), but this result was not accompanied by any VA improvement. The aspect of choroid blush showed no correlation with the management of thrombolysis.ConclusionIn situ fibrinolysis was more effective than medical treatments or natural evolution of CRAO (VA improvement was respectively 40% and 20%). However, the benefit/risk ratio must be discussed, and an angio-CT of supra-aortic trunks could be systematically performed before thrombolysis, to assess the potential VA recovery compared with complications such as ischemic stroke."

We included 150 patients with acute massive (n = 31) or submassive (n = 119) PE. We used 24 mg of tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) administered either as 1 mg/h for 24 h with a unilateral catheter or 1 mg/h/catheter for 12 h with bilateral catheters. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding within 72 h of procedure initiation. The primary efficacy outcome was the change in the chest CT–measured RV/LV diameter ratio within 48 h of procedure initiation.ResultsMean RV/LV diameter ratio decreased from baseline to 48 h post-procedure (1.55 vs. 1.13; mean difference, −0.42; p &lt; 0.0001). Mean pulmonary artery systolic pressure (51.4 mm Hg vs. 36.9 mm Hg; p &lt; 0.0001) and modified Miller Index score (22.5 vs. 15.8; p &lt; 0.0001) also decreased post-procedure.

However, there is little information on the effects of CNTs on fibrinolysis. We investigated the role of pristine-commercial single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with &lt;3% Co content in fibrinolysis and their contribution to the induction of pro-thrombotic processes in human vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). SWCNTs alone produced concentration-dependent oxidation, as measured by a dithiothreitol oxidation assay. Internalized SWCNTs were located in HUVEC treated with 25μg/ml using transmission electron microscopy, whereas treatment with 50μg/ml compromised cell viability, and oxidative stress increased significantly at 5μg/ml. The study showed that in HUVEC treated with 25μg SWCNT/ml, fibrinolysis-related gene expression and protein levels had increased by 3–12h after treatment (serpine-1: 13-fold; PLAT: 11-fold and PLAU: 2-fold), but only the PAI-1 protein was increased (1.5-fold), whereas tissue and urokinase plasminogen activator proteins (tPA and uPA, respectively) tended to decrease. In summary, pristine SWCNTs treatment resulted in evident HUVEC damage caused by cell fiber contact, internalization, and oxidative stress due to contaminant metals. The generation of endothelial dysfunction, as shown by the altered expression of genes and proteins involved in fibrinolysis, suggest that SWCNTs display pro-thrombotic effects."

In contrast, endogenous fibrinolysis, using one-thousandth of the t-PA concentration, is regularly lysing fibrin and induced Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade 3 patency in 15% of patients with acute myocardial infarction. This efficacy is due to the effects of t-PA and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA). They are complementary in fibrinolysis so that in combination, their effect is synergistic. Lysis of intact fibrin is initiated by t-PA, and uPA activates the remaining plasminogens. Knockout of the uPA gene, but not the t-PA gene, inhibited fibrinolysis. In the clinic, a minibolus of t-PA followed by an infusion of uPA was administered to 101 patients with acute myocardial infarction; superior infarct artery patency, no reocclusions, and 1% mortality resulted.

But the relation of VT with TAFI gene SNPs could not be clearly demonstrated. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to analyze the associations between three TAFI variants −438G/A, 505G/A and 1040C/T and the risk of venous thrombosis.MethodsWe carried out a systematic search to obtain all the eligible studies published before 30th October 2014. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were computed to assess the association.Results13 eligible studies were enrolled including 2321 patients and 2464 controls. There was a significant association between 505G/A and the risk of VTD under all models except recessive model (G vs. A: OR=1.13, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.26; GG vs. AA:OR=1.47, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.88; GA vs. AA: OR=1.36, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.73; GG+GA vs. AA: OR=1.41, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.77). Similarly, obvious relationship was observed in subgroup analyses in light of type of disease and ethnicity. Likewise, for 1040C/T variant, significant associations were identified under homozygote, heterozygote and dominant models (CC vs. TT: OR=1.65, 95% CI: 1.06, 2.59; CT vs. TT: OR=1.55, 95% CI: 1.19, 2.03; CC+CT vs. TT: OR=1.55, 95% CI: 1.20, 2.00). Sub-analysis presented significant associations in non-CVT and non-Asian group under homozygote, heterozygote, and dominant models and CVT group in recessive model.ConclusionThis meta-analysis showed that −438G/A variant was not associated with the incidence of venous thrombosis. But in non-Asian populations, G allele and GG genotype of 505G/A may increase the risk of venous thrombosis diseases. GG genotype of 505G/A and one C carrier (CC and CT) of 1040C/T gave rise to the development of venous thrombosis diseases except CVT. Additionally, the heterozygote CT may be a potential contributing factor of gene effect in venous thrombosis."
"Denser plasma clot formation and impaired fibrinolysis in paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation while on sinus rhythm: Association with thrombin generation, endothelial injury and platelet activation","{'author': [{'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Drabik', 'given-name': 'Leszek'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Wołkow', 'given-name': 'Paweł'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Undas', 'given-name': 'Anetta'}]}",August 2015,http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384815300062,1-s2.0-S0049384815300062,"AbstractIntroductionFormation of compact and poorly lysable fibrin clots have been demonstrated in patients following ischemic stroke. Recently, it has been shown that denser fibrin networks and impaired fibrinolysis occurs in subjects with permanent atrial fibrillation (AF). Fibrin clot phenotype in other types of AF remains to be established. We evaluated fibrin clot properties in paroxysmal (PAF) and persistent AF (PsAF).Material and MethodsWe studied 88 non-anticoagulated patients with AF on sinus rhythm and free of stroke (41 with PAF, 47 with PsAF) versus 50 controls. Ex-vivo plasma fibrin clot permeability (Ks) and clot lysis time (CLT) were evaluated along with von Willebrand factor (vWF), peak thrombin generation (TG), platelet factor 4 (PF4) and fibrinolytic proteins.ResultsCompared with control subjects, clots obtained from plasma of patients with PAF and PsAF had similarly lower Ks (−7.7%, P=0.01; −8.6%, P=0.005, respectively) and prolonged CLT (+10.8%, P=0.006; +7.8% P=0.04, respectively). No associations of Ks and CLT with CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED score were observed. Patients with AF had higher TG, vWF, PF4 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen compared with controls. Multiple linear regression adjusted for age, gender, body mass index and fibrinogen showed that TG (β=−0.41), vWF (β=−0.29) and PF4 (β=−0.28) are the independent predictors of Ks (R2=0.78), while CLT was independently predicted by TG (β=0.37), PAI-1 antigen (β=0.29) and vWF (β=0.26) in the AF group (R2=0.39).ConclusionsPatients with PAF and PsAF while on sinus rhythm display unfavorably altered fibrin clot properties, which might contribute to thromboembolic complications."

Taurocholic acid (TUCA), a bile acid, has been shown to regulate cellular activity and promote fibrin sealant degradation. We hypothesize that TUCA impairs whole blood clot formation and promotes fibrinolysis.MethodsTUCA was exogenously added to whole blood obtained from volunteers. A titration from 250 μM–750 μM was used due to biologic relevance. Whole blood mixtures were assayed using thrombelastography for clot strength (maximum amplitude [MA]) and fibrinolysis (LY30) quantification. Tranexamic acid was used to block plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis. Platelet microfluidics were performed. A proteomic analysis was completed on citrated plasma obtained from a shock and resuscitation rat model.ResultsFibrinolysis increased when 750-μM TUCA was added to whole blood (median LY30 0.08–5.7, P = 0.010) and clot strength decreased (median MA of 53.3–43.8, P = 0.010). The addition of tranexamic acid, to a 750-μM TUCA titration, partially reversed the induced fibrinolysis (LY30: without 7.7 versus with 2.7) and the decrease in clot strength (MA: without 48.2 versus with 53.2), but did not reverse the effects to whole blood levels. Platelet function reduced by 50% in the presence of 100-μM TUCA. Rats had a median 52-fold increase in TUCA, after a shock state that stayed elevated after resuscitation.ConclusionsTUCA reduces clot strength and promotes fibrinolysis. The clot strength reduction is attributable to platelet inhibition. This metabolic effect on coagulation warrants further investigation, as localized areas of the body, with high levels of bile acid, may be at risk for postoperative bleeding."

Exercise enhances blood coagulation and fibrinolysis in healthy subjects, but its haemostatic effects in AS are unknown. We sought to investigate how stress echocardiography alters blood coagulation and fibrinolysis in AS patients free of significant atherosclerotic vascular disease.MethodsWe studied 32 consecutive asymptomatic moderate-to-severe AS patients and 32 age- and sex-matched controls. We measured peak thrombin generated using calibrated automated thrombogram, clot lysis time (CLT), and fibrinolytic markers at four time points, i.e. at rest, at peak exercise, and 1h and 24h after a symptom-limited exercise test.ResultsWe observed that peak thrombin generated rose at peak exercise to 25% higher value in the patients than in controls (p&lt;0.001) and reached its highest level 24h from exercise in AS patients while it decreased post-exercise in controls. Baseline CLT was 13% longer in AS patients (p=0.006) and associated with thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) activity (r=0.69, p&lt;0.001), antiplasmin (r=0.47, p=0.007), and plasminogen (r=−0.55, p=0.001). In AS, CLT remained unaltered at peak exercise, while it decreased in controls, yielding the intergroup difference of 28% (p&lt;0.001). Twenty-four hours after exercise CLT became 15% longer in AS patients (p&lt;0.001). This hypofibrinolytic effect followed a similar pattern observed for TAFI activity.ConclusionsAsymptomatic moderate-to-severe AS patients respond to exercise with more pronounced and prolonged increase in thrombin generation, together with impaired fibrinolysis as compared to controls. Repeated episodes of exercise-induced prothrombotic state in AS might contribute to the progression of this disease."
Endogenous Fibrinolysis An Important Mediator of Thrombus Formation and Cardiovascular Risk,"{'author': [{'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Okafor', 'given-name': 'Osita N.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Gorog', 'given-name': 'Diana A.'}]}",28 April 2015,http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735109715007305,1-s2.0-S0735109715007305,"AbstractMost acute cardiovascular events are attributable to arterial thrombosis. Plaque rupture or erosion stimulates platelet activation, aggregation, and thrombosis, whilst simultaneously activating enzymatic processes that mediate endogenous fibrinolysis to physiologically maintain vessel patency. Interplay between these pathways determines clinical outcome. If proaggregatory factors predominate, the thrombus may propagate, leading to vessel occlusion. However, if balanced by a healthy fibrinolytic system, thrombosis may not occur or cause lasting occlusion. Despite abundant evidence for the fibrinolytic system regulating thrombosis, it has been overlooked compared with platelet reactivity, partly due to a lack of techniques to measure it. We evaluate evidence for endogenous fibrinolysis in arterial thrombosis and review techniques to assess it, including biomarkers and global assays, such as thromboelastography and the Global Thrombosis Test. Global assays, simultaneously assessing proaggregatory and fibrinolytic pathways, could play a role in risk stratification and in identifying impaired fibrinolysis as a potential target for pharmacological modulation."

A group of 300 females was recruited in this study; of these 150 unrelated patients with different stages of BC and 150 age-matched healthy controls. Plasma TAFI Ag was measured by ELISA and TAFI Thr325Ile (rs1926447) polymorphism was genotyped using TaqMan single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping assay. The results showed the genotypes of the minor allele; Thr/Ile (CT) and Ile/Ile (TT) were significantly more frequent in patients compared to control group (50.0% and 22.0% vs. 42.0% and 13.3%, respectively) and were also associated with BC susceptibility [OR=1.9 and 2.6; 95% CI: (1.1–3.3) and (1.3–5.5), respectively P=0.01]. Ile325 allele carriers were more frequent in cases than in controls (47.0% vs. 34.0%) [OR=1.7, (95% CI=1.2–2.4), P=0.001]. However, TAFI Thr325Ile polymorphism was not associated with BC stage or other clincopathological characteristics. TAFI Ag levels were correlated with advanced stages of BC, poor prognosis and risk of recurrence (P=0.02, P=0.04 and P &lt;0.001, respectively) and Thr325Ile SNP was significantly correlated with TAFI antigen levels with the C/C genotype corresponding to the highest and the T/T genotype to the lowest TAFI antigen levels (P&lt;0.001) in the study groups. In conclusion, this study showed for the first time that TAFI Thr325Ile polymorphism could have a contribution to BC susceptibility in our population. Furthermore, high TAFI plasma levels may serve as a predictor of poor prognosis in patients with BC."

Patients with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score higher than 1 (n = 57) were followed for 72 hours. Prothrombin fragments 1 + 2, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (aPAI-1), ROTEM, and routine coagulation tests were measured daily along with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores.ResultsThe activity of functional aPAI-1 increased with increasing severity of organ failure (P = .01) and was higher as compared with healthy controls (95% confidence interval, −65.4 to −29.9; P &lt; .001). There was a decreasing trend in ML with increased organ failure (P = .001); however, there was no trend in d-dimer. Among all tests, only the lower ML (ß = −0.38, P &lt; .001) and higher international normalized ratio (INR; ß = 0.32, P = .002) values significantly contributed to greater severity of organ failure (R2 = 0.35, F2,73 = 19.29, P &lt; .001). Despite an increase in INR, the prothrombin fragment remained unchanged (P = .89).

Further studies are required, as ROTEM could aid selection of patients and guide interventions aimed at fibrinolysis in severe sepsis."

The primary endpoint was 30-day death or reinfarction. The key secondary endpoint was in-hospital major bleeding. The relationship between fibrinolysis to angiography time and symptom onset to angiography time with outcomes was studied using 2- and 4-h intervals, respectively, and in multivariable models.ResultsAmong 1,238 patients, the median fibrinolysis to angiography time was 165 min, and the median symptom onset to angiography time was 5.33 h. The primary and key secondary endpoints occurred in 5.7% and 4.7%, respectively. These main endpoints did not vary significantly with increasing fibrinolysis to angiography time. Early angiography (&lt;2 h) after fibrinolysis was not associated with increased bleeding. Recurrent ischemia increased with increasing fibrinolysis to angiography time (3.7% to 7.9%, p for trend = 0.02). Thirty-day and 1-year death/reinfarction and 30-day recurrent ischemia increased significantly with increasing symptom onset to angiography time. Neither fibrinolysis to angiography time nor symptom onset to angiography time was an independent predictor of the primary endpoint. Only symptom onset to angiography time was an independent predictor of 1-year death/reinfarction (hazard ratio: 1.07, 95% confidence interval: 1.02 to 1.12, p = 0.01).ConclusionsVery early angiography (&lt;2 h) after fibrinolysis was not associated with an increased risk of 30-day death/reinfarction or in-hospital major bleeding, and angiography within 4 h after fibrinolysis was associated with reduced 30-day recurrent ischemia. A shorter symptom onset to angiography time (&lt;4 h) was associated with reduced 30-day and 1-year death/reinfarction and 30-day recurrent ischemia. In the current environment of regional networks of 24/7 primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) centers, the clinical implication of these findings is that patients initially treated with fibrinolysis should also be promptly transferred to the nearest PCI center for immediate angiography and PCI.

Fibrinolysis efficiency is greatly influenced by clot structure, fibrinogen isoforms and polymorphisms, the rate of thrombin generation, the reactivity of thrombus-associated cells such as platelets, and the overall biochemical environment. Regulation of the fibrinolytic system, like that of the coagulation cascade, is accomplished by a wide array of cofactors, receptors, and inhibitors. Fibrinolytic activity can be generated either on the surface of a fibrin-containing thrombus, or on cells that express profibrinolytic receptors. In a widening spectrum of clinical disorders, acquired and congenital defects in fibrinolysis contribute to disease morbidity, and new assays of global fibrinolysis now have potential predictive value in multiple clinical settings. Here, we summarize the basic elements of the fibrinolytic system, points of interaction with the coagulation pathway, and some recent clinical advances."

Arterial stenosis is characterized by a lowered ankle-brachial-pressure index (ABPI), whereas calcified arteries lead to an increased ABPI. The current study investigates whether inflammatory and oxidative stress markers differ in low versus high ABPI groups suggesting different biochemical processes.MethodsEighty-seven patients attending the diabetes complications clinic agreed to the study. Participants were divided into a low (&lt;1.07) and a high (&gt;1.23) ABPI tertile groups and compared for traditional and emerging biomarker differences. A clinical history and demographic data were obtained. Emerging biomarkers included C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, 8-hydroxy deoxy-guanosine, D-dimer, reduced glutathione and malondialdehyde. Data was analyzed using a Student T-test with significance set at 0.05. A multivariate normal linear regression model was applied to determine the contributions of traditional and emerging biomarkers to the classification of low and high ABPI.ResultsNo differences were observed between the two groups for the traditional biomarkers but D-dimer (p&lt;0.001) and glutathione (p&lt;0.05) were significantly different between the groups. The best model for predicting ABPI class included the emerging biomarkers C-reactive protein, D-dimer and Interleukin-6 combined with BGL, HbA1c and SBP (p&lt;0.001) as compared to the best traditional biomarker model of HbA1c, atherogenic index of plasma, low-density lipoprotein and SBP (p&lt;0.05).DiscussionA decreased inflammatory component with increased oxidative stress is more likely to lead to calcification of the arteries and a higher ABPI, despite normal BGL, HbA1c and cholesterol profile. Our study shows that emerging biomarkers provide a sound basis for differentiating pathophysiological processes associated with low and high ABPI. Traditional biomarkers showed a high accuracy for identification of low ABPI in our model but failed to do better than chance for identification of high ABPI, suggesting different pathophysiological pathways that include oxidative stress and inflammatory components. Clinically, validation of novel and more comprehensive risk factors for PVD sheds light on the etiology of the disease and mechanics of progression toward better preventative care, early detection and targeted drug delivery."

Tissue-type plasminogen activator, the most well-recognized plasminogen activator, was harnessed for therapeutic benefit against thromboembolic disorders more than 30 years ago, whereas inhibition of this system has been proven effective for certain bleeding disorders. However, in recent years, new and unexpected functional roles for this system have been identified mostly in relation to the central nervous system that are both unrelated and independent of fibrin degradation and clot removal. Hence, it seems reasonable to ask whether agents used to modify components or activities of the fibrinolytic system have any clinical consequences unrelated to their intended use in hemostasis. This review will provide an overview of these new features of the fibrinolytic system and will also focus on prospective considerations in the use of fibrinolytic and antifibrinolytic agents."

Urokinase (uPA) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) are used for IVF in Human. No clinical trial has evaluated the differential impact of these two fibrinolytics for IVF. Thus, we decided here to compare the use of these two fibrinolytics in a pre-clinical study. IVH was induced in rats by injection of collagenase type VII within the brain parenchyma followed by an IVF. Rats were randomized to receive uPA, tPA or saline within the ventricle, and cerebrospinal fluid was aspirated. Hematoma and ventricular volumes, brain water contents, inflammation and neurological deficits were measured at day three post-treatments. We also performed in vitro studies, in which neuronal cultures were subjected to an excitotoxic paradigm in the presence of either uPA or tPA. In the IVH model, we showed that although both uPA and tPA led to reduced ventricular volumes, only uPA significantly improved functional recovery. These results could be explained by the fact that uPA, in contrast of tPA, fails to promote inflammatory processes and neurotoxicity. Our study provides evidence supporting the use of uPA for fibrinolysis of IVH. A clinical trial could be warranted if tPA failed to improve outcomes in human IVH."

Given recent data on prothrombotic fibrin clot phenotype reported in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), we tested the hypothesis that altered fibrin clot properties are associated with increased intima-media thickness (IMT) observed in PAPS.Materials and methodsWe studied 30 consecutive patients with PAPS and 30 controls matched for age, sex and the type of previous thromboembolism. We assessed plasma fibrin clot permeability (Ks) and clot lysis time (CLT) with their potential determinants. The IMT was measured in 3 segments of the carotid arteries.ResultsPatients with APS had 15.2% lower Ks (p=0.002) and 9.7% prolonged CLT (p=0.039) compared with controls. The IMT in the APS group was greater in the common carotid artery (5.7%; p=0.002), at the bifurcation (17.46%; p&lt;0.001), and the internal artery (9.26%; p=0.015). Patients with triple positivity in the antiphospholipid antibody profile (n=9; 30%) had lower Ks and greater IMT (both, p&lt;0.05), compared with those with single positivity (n=13; 43.3%). Multivariate analysis adjusted for potential confounders showed that in APS patients, oxidized low-density lipoproteins (p=0.019) were the only independent predictor of Ks, while thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor activity (p&lt;0.001) predicted CLT. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) was found to be the independent predictor of the IMT in the common carotid artery (p=0.004), and in the internal carotid artery (p&lt;0.001).ConclusionsReduced Ks and susceptibility to lysis are associated with greater IMT in PAPS, which might contribute to the early atherosclerosis in this disease."

We studied the kinetics of clot retraction and the fibrinolysis rate in whole blood from 48 PV patients and 48 healthy controls. Measurements were performed before and after isovolemic eryhrocytapheresis (ECP). CR was measured by optical method. Clot lysis time (CLT) and maximum clot firmness (MCF) were measured by thromboelastometry in recalcified blood supplemented with t-PA and tissue factor.Compared with healthy controls, CR rate in PV patients was higher (0.0219 vs. 0.0138; p&lt;0.001), the clot volume smaller and MCF elevated (64 vs. 58mm). CR rate correlated with platelet count (r=0.546; p=0.001) but not with erythrocyte concentration (r=0.192; p&gt;0.3). Compared with healthy controls, CLT in PV patients was significantly prolonged (158min vs. 71min). Fibrinolysis rate inversely correlated with CR rate (r=-0.566; p&lt;0.001); MCF (r=-0.704; p&lt;0.001) and platelet count (r=-0.461; p&lt;0.001). As judged by confocal microscope, in comparison to healthy controls, clots formed in blood from PV patients demonstrated booth a distinctly higher degree of crosslinking and possessed thinner fibers. Altered CR, MCF and fibrinolysis speeds were not normalized following the ECP procedure. Tirofiban (a blocker of platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptors), unlike aspirin, normalized abnormal CR and fibrinolysis in blood from PV patients. Collectively, our data indicate that in PV patients, abnormal CR may result in formation of thrombi that are more resistant to fibrinolysis. ECP and aspirin failed to normalize platelet-related fibrinolysis resistance."

In this post hoc subgroup analysis, we compared the efficacy of these strategies in relation to the initial troponin status at hospital presentation for the primary composite end point of mortality, reinfarction, recurrent ischemia, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock at 30 days. We assessed the heterogeneity of treatment effect with initial troponin status using the Breslow-Day test and tested for interaction after adjustment for baseline Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk score.ResultsAmong 1059 patients, those with abnormal initial troponin levels (n = 514 [48.5%]) were older with worse Killip class, had a longer time from symptom onset to fibrinolysis, and had higher GRACE and Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction risk scores. Patients with abnormal troponin levels had higher rates of the primary end point (17.5% vs 10.8%; P = 0.002) and cumulative mortality or reinfarction at 1 year (14.0% vs 8.1%; P = 0.003). In stratified analyses, pharmacoinvasive management reduced the primary end point only among patients with normal initial troponin status. However, there was no significant treatment heterogeneity (all P ≥ 0.10) and no interaction between initial troponin status and treatment assignment after adjusting for GRACE risk score.ConclusionsPatients with STEMI and abnormal initial troponin levels had worse short-term and long-term outcomes. Accounting for overall baseline risk with the GRACE risk score, troponin status did not modulate the efficacy of pharmacoinvasive management."

Among these articles were 19 studies of Ala147Thr and 15 of Thr325Ile variants, comprising 4,977 CVD patients and 8,082 controls together with 4,890 cases and 8,311 controls, respectively. There were no significant associations between Ala147Thr variant and CVD under allele, dominant, recessive genetic models. Similar results were observed when end-point, ethnicity, sample size, genotyping method were taken into account. Likewise, meta-analysis of Thr325Ile variant did not show significant associations with CVD under three genetic models. Nevertheless, in sub-analysis based on end-point, the TT(Ile/Ile) genotype was associated with a 25% higher risk of coronary heart disease(CHD) (OR=1.25, 95%CI, 1.02–1.54; P=0.03) compared with TC+CC(Thr/Ile+Thr/Thr) genotype(recessive model).ConclusionsThe present meta-analysis failed to confirm the influence of Ala147Thr and Thr325Ile variants on the susceptibility to CVD.

Dyslipidemia also affects the hemostatic system, especially impairing fibrinolysis, and increased levels of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) have been associated with cardiovascular events.Objectives and methodsThis study evaluated the association of acquired risk factors (hypertension, body mass index — BMI, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, use or not of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, and post-menopause status), the polymorphisms Thr325Ile (rs1926447), Ala147Thr (rs3742264) and +1542C/G (rs940) in the TAFI gene, and TAFI plasma levels in 109 dyslipidemic and 105 normolipemic individuals. Biochemical analyses and TAFI levels were evaluated by colorimetric/turbidimetric assays and ELISA, respectively. Genotypic and allelic frequencies were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).ResultsHypertension, increased BMI, and menopause were more common in dyslipidemic individuals, who had higher TAFI levels. The alleles 325Ile, Ala147, and C showed association with lower TAFI levels. The rs3742264 polymorphism was associated with dyslipidemia in males.ConclusionsThe results suggest that TAFI levels are independently associated to dyslipidemia and that the polymorphism rs3742264 may be related to cardiovascular risk in male subjects."

We investigated hemostatic abnormalities in adult Fontan patients.MethodsForty-eight Fontan patients between ages 18 and 40 years, including 10 (21%) patients with previous thromboembolism 5 to 15 years after surgery, and 35 control subjects matched for age and sex were studied. Coagulation factors and inhibitors, together with markers of fibrinolysis, platelets, and endothelial activation, were determined in peripheral venous blood plasma.ResultsCompared with control subjects, Fontan patients showed lower, although mostly within normal ranges, values of all coagulation factors, as well as reduced free protein S, in association with higher antithrombin and free tissue factor pathway inhibitor levels. Thrombin generation, reflected by prothrombin fragment 1.2, and platelet activation markers were increased in Fontan patients. The plasma clot lysis time was prolonged in Fontan patients, which was associated with an increased activity of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor. Fontan patients with previous thromboembolism had lower oxygen saturation, coagulation factors V and VIII, and free protein S, and increased von Willebrand factor, soluble CD40 ligand, and P-selectin. Other laboratory or clinical parameters were not associated with prior thrombotic episodes.ConclusionsAdult Fontan patients are characterized by enhanced platelet activation and endothelial injury, heightened thrombin formation, and impaired fibrinolysis. Patients showed reduced free protein S levels, increased platelet activation, and endothelial damage after thromboembolic events observed late after Fontan surgery. Our findings indicate novel prothrombotic mechanisms in adult Fontan patients, which might help to optimize thromboprophylaxis."

Clustering of cardiovascular risk factors leading to endothelial dysfunction and impaired fibrinolysis has also been reported and may account for progression to overt vascular changes in these patients. However, effect of long lasting GH replacement therapy on fibrinolytic capacity in GH deficient patients has not been investigated so far.ObjectiveTo investigate fibrinolysis before and after challenge with venous occlusion in GHD patients with hypopituitarism before and during one year of growth hormone replacement.DesignHospital based, interventional, prospective study.Investigated subjectsTwenty one patient with GHD and fourteen healthy control subjects matched for age, sex and body mass index (BMI).MethodsAnthropometric, metabolic and fibrinolytic parameters were measured at the start and after three, six and twelve months of treatment with human recombinant GH.ResultsAt baseline GHD patients had significantly impaired fibrinolysis compared to healthy persons. During treatment with GH, significant changes were observed in insulin like growth factor 1(IGF-1) [from baseline 6.9(2.4–13.5) to 22.0(9.0–33.0) nmol/l after one month of treatment; p&lt;0.01] and fibrinolysis. Improvement in fibrinolysis was mostly attributed to improvement of stimulated endothelial tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) release in response to venous occlusion [from baseline 1.1(0.4–2.6) to 1.9(0.5–8.8) after one year of treatment; p&lt;0.01].ConclusionGrowth hormone replacement therapy has favorable effects on t-PA release from endothelium and net fibrinolytic capacity in GHD adults, which may contribute to decrease their risk of vascular complications."

Paradoxical strokes, presumed to be caused by fibrin-rich clots originating in the venous circulation, may respond better to fibrinolysis than other ischemic stroke subtypes. In this study, we compared the response with IV rt-PA in paradoxical stroke patients and other stroke subtypes.MethodsIn total, 486 patients treated with IV rt-PA at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Adjudication of stroke mechanism was based on chart review. Five major stroke mechanisms—cardioembolic, artery-to-artery emboli, lacunar, cryptogenic, and paradoxical—were identified by final diagnosis from chart reviews. Mimics, undefined etiology, and defined etiology not falling into the major mechanisms were excluded. Analysis of variance and general linear model were used to assess the differences between groups.ResultsA total of 323 patients were analyzed. We found significant differences in clinical outcome between stroke mechanisms, including discharge National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) (P = .007), discharge Rankin (P = .011), discharge disposition (P = .000), and infarct volume (P = .007). Post hoc analysis showed that cardioembolic patients had the worst outcomes (discharge NIHSS score 11.12 ± 12.26), whereas paradoxical strokes had the best outcomes (discharge NIHSS score 3.67 ± 4.90), but these did not approach statistical significance. However, regression analysis showed that 4 variables—congestive heart failure, admission NIHSS, age, and mean infarct volume—rather than stroke mechanism were the true predictors of poor outcome.ConclusionsParadoxical strokes had better outcomes after IV fibrinolysis than other ischemic stroke subtypes, but this difference is attributable to younger age and milder stroke severity on presentation."

In that study no advantages to VATS were identified, although VATS resulted in significantly higher hospital charges. We subsequently implemented the algorithm from the trial utilizing primary fibrinolytic therapy in all children diagnosed with empyema. In this study, we reviewed our experience to examine the clinical efficacy of this protocol.MethodsAfter IRB approval, we conducted a retrospective review of all children diagnosed with empyema as all were treated with the fibrinolysis protocol utilized in the prospective trial since the completion of the trial.ResultsIn 102 consecutive patients treated with fibrinolysis, 16 patients (15.7%) required subsequent VATS. No patients were treated with initial VATS. No major side effects were seen from fibrinolytic therapy. Mean operative time for VATS after fibrinolysis was 62minutes. The length of stay after VATS was 5.9days.ConclusionsThe results of an evidence-based protocol using fibrinolysis to treat empyema have replicated the results of the trial that led to the implementation of the protocol.

The aim of this study was to examine the pathophysiological relationships between coagulation, fibrinolysis and fibrinolytic shutdown by evaluating the levels of coagulofibrinolytic markers, including soluble fibrin, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), tissue plasminogen activator-plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 complex (tPAIC), plasmin-alpha2 plasmin inhibitor complex (PPIC), neutrophil elastase and fibrin degradation product by neutrophil elastase (EXDP).Materials and MethodsFifty-two resuscitated patients were divided into two groups: 22 DIC and 30 non-DIC patients.ResultsThe levels of soluble fibrin, PPIC, tPAIC, EXDP and neutrophil elastase in the DIC patients with PCAS were significantly higher than those observed in the non-DIC patients. The values of the tPAIC and JAAM DIC scores were found to be independent predictors of increased SOFA scores in the DIC patients. The MODS patients demonstrated significantly higher levels of soluble fibrin and tPAIC; however, the levels of TAFI and EXDP were identical between the patients with and without MODS. In addition, positive correlations were observed between the levels of tPAIC and EXDP in the patients with non-MODS; however, no correlations were observed between these markers in the MODS patients.ConclusionsThrombin activation and fibrinolytic shutdown play important roles in the development of organ dysfunction in PCAS patients. Neutrophil elastase-mediated fibrinolysis cannot overcome the fibrinolytic shutdown that occurs in DIC patients with PCAS, thus resulting in the development of MODS."
Role of routine early angiography post-fibrinolysis for ST elevation myocardial infarction — A meta-regression analysis using angiography rate in the non-routine arm,"{'author': [{'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Wong', 'given-name': 'Cheuk-Kit'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Leon de la Barra', 'given-name': 'Sophia'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Herbison', 'given-name': 'Peter'}]}",1 September 2013,http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167527312005888,1-s2.0-S0167527312005888,"AbstractBackgroundThe current European and American Guidelines differ with regard to the recommended level for the use of routine early angiography after fibrinolysis for STEMI. Previous meta-analyses on randomized controlled trials have supported the routine early approach, but its advantage may be because of an excessively low angiography rate among patients in the non-routine strategy arm of the trials.MethodsWe update the meta-analysis and apply meta-regression to evaluate whether the difference in outcome between the 2 randomized arms could be explained by the angiography rates in the non-routine strategy arm. Because reinfarction and recurrent ischemia are often the reported indication for angiography, we only use mortality endpoint in our meta-regression analysis.ResultsAmong the eight trials included with 3195 patients, the angiography rate in the non-routine strategy arms ranges from 15% to 100%. The overall odds ratio for 30-day mortality comparing the routine early angiography arm vs the non-routine arm is 0.86 (95% confidence interval 0.60–1.24). On the plot listing the eight trials according to angiography rates, there is no visual trend in the odds ratio estimates for mortality when comparing the 2 treatment strategies as angiography rate decreases. In meta-regression analysis, angiography rate does not predict 30-day mortality (p=0.461).ConclusionFor STEMI, mortality endpoint trumps the softer endpoints of recurrent infarction and ischemia. The current study shows that the equipoise between the routine early invasive versus the non-routine strategy on 30-day mortality cannot be explained by the variable performance of angiography in the non-routine strategy arm."
Proteolytic modulation of factor Xa–antithrombin complex enhances fibrinolysis in plasma,"{'author': [{'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Talbot', 'given-name': 'Kimberley'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Meixner', 'given-name': 'Scott C.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Pryzdial', 'given-name': 'Edward L.G.'}]}",June 2013,http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1570963913000708,1-s2.0-S1570963913000708,"AbstractOur previous work showed that purified coagulation factor Xa (FXa) acquires fibrinolysis cofactor activity after plasmin-mediated cleavage. The predominant functional species is a non-covalent heterodimer of 33 and 13kDa, termed Xa33/13, which has predicted newly exposed C-terminal lysines that are important for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-mediated plasminogen activation to plasmin. To provide evidence that this mechanism occurs in a physiological context, here we demonstrated the appearance of Xa33 in clotting plasma by western blot analysis. Since the normal fate of FXa is stable association with antithrombin (AT), an AT western blot was conducted, which revealed a band of ~13kDa higher apparent molecular weight than AT that appeared concurrent to Xa33. Sequencing of purified proteins confirmed the generation of Xa13 covalently bound to AT and Xa33 (Xa33/13-AT) by cleavages at Lys–Met339 and Lys–Asp389. Ligand blots demonstrated 125I-plasminogen binding to the Xa33 subunit of plasmin-generated Xa33/13-AT. Purified XaAT added to plasma that was induced to clot enhanced the rate of tPA-mediated fibrinolysis by ~16-fold. Similarly, purified plasminogen activation by tPA was enhanced by ~16-fold by XaAT. Plasmin cleaves XaAT and exposes plasminogen binding sites at least 10-fold faster than FXa. Here we demonstrate a novel function for AT, which accelerates the modulation of FXa into the fibrinolytic form, Xa33/13. The consequent exposure of C-terminal lysine binding sites essential for plasminogen activation enhances fibrinolysis. These results are consistent with a model where auxiliary cofactors link coagulation to fibrinolysis by priming the accelerating role of fibrin."

Although several methods have been developed to measure plasmin activity and plasminogen (the plasmin precursor) concentrations, they are only moderately sensitive and quantitative and require large amounts of reagents, limiting their applicability. We developed two simple, label-free homogeneous assays using gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) for detection of fibrinolysis-related proteins and their activator (urokinase that converts plasminogen to plasmin) and inhibitor (α2-plasmin inhibitor that inhibits plasmin and plasminogen bound to fibrin). We used a fibrinolysis-based sensor, based on plasmin-mediated cleavage of fibrinogen-modified Au NPs (Fib-Au NPs) leading to aggregation of Au NPs, to determine plasmin activity in a biological medium mimic solution. A combination of thrombin (Thr) and Fib-Au NPs allowed us to analyze plasmin activity and plasminogen concentrations in serum through Thr-induced agglutination of Fib-Au NPs. The limit of detection (LOD; S/N=3) of this sensor for plasmin in serum was 0.4nM (ca. 1.7×10−4unitmL−1). These label-free assays offer several advantages over conventional assays, including allowing rapid and simple readings with the naked eye or measurement by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy."

Thus, inhibiting PAI-1 activity is clinically desirable. We recently demonstrated that tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) remains on the surface of vascular endothelial cells (VECs) after secretion in a heavy-chain dependent manner, which is essential for high fibrinolytic activity on the surface of VECs, and that PAI-1 dissociates retained tPA from the cell surface as a result of high-molecular weight complex formation. Based on the model whereby amounts of tPA and its equilibrium with PAI-1 dynamically change after exocytosis, we examined how TM5275, a newly synthesized small molecule PAI-1 inhibitor, modulated tPA retention and VEC surface-derived fibrinolytic activity using microscopic techniques.Materials and methodsThe effects of TM5275 on the kinetics of the secretion and retention of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged tPA (tPA-GFP) on VECs were analyzed using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. The effects of TM5275 on the generation of plasmin activity were evaluated by both plasminogen accumulation and fibrin clot lysis on tPA-GFP-expressing VECs using confocal laser scanning microscopy.ResultsTM5275 at concentrations of 20 and 100μM significantly prolonged the retention of tPA-GFP on VECs by inhibiting tPA-GFP-PAI-1 high-molecular-weight complex formation. TM5275 enhanced the time-dependent accumulation of plasminogen as well as the dissolution of fibrin clots on and around the tPA-GFP-expressing cells.ConclusionsThe profibrinolytic effects of TM5275 were clearly demonstrated by the prolongation of tPA retention and enhancement of plasmin generation on the VEC surface as a result of PAI-1 inhibition."

Graeb score 6 or above subjected to intraventricular fibrinolysis. We gathered demographic parameters, clinical risk scores, tomography data and case histories showing neurological status and complications related to intraventricular treatment. The results between those who died and the survivors were compared.ResultsIntraventricular fibrinolysis was performed in 42 patients (69% males) with intraventricular hemorrhage. The average age was 58.36 years (SD 16.67), with a median APACHE II score of 17.5 (r 3–29). A total of 16.7% were receiving acenocoumarol, and 7.1% were on antiplatelet drugs. The median Glasgow Coma Score at the start of treatment was 8 (r 3–13). The median Graeb score was 9 (r 6–12), and was severe (Graeb 9–12) in almost 62%. In turn, 26.2% of the patients developed ventriculitis, and there was further bleeding in 7.1%. Death occurred in 50% of the cases. None of the analyzed variables were significantly related to increased mortality. In the 21 survivors, the Glasgow Outcome Score at 3 months was 2 in 23.8% of the cases, 3 in 28.57%, 4 in 23.8% and 5 in 28.57% of the patients.ConclusionsIntraventricular fibrinolysis does not appear to involve a high rate of complications, and may result in lesser mortality, with a better functional outcome after three months than that estimated and published in the literature in reference to intraventricular hemorrhage."

The kinetics and duration of this phase should be defined to adjust the duration of antifibrinolytic treatment with tranexamic acid (TXA).ObjectiveWe aimed to quantify the duration of postoperative fibrinolysis and to assess the biological impact of TXA administration.Materials and MethodsFourteen patients undergoing total hip replacement (THR) and 10 patients undergoing total knee replacement (TKR) with tourniquet were included in an observational, prospective, single-center study. Among these patients, 7 THR patients and 5 TKR patients received TXA (15mg/kg IV intraoperatively, followed by continuous infusion of 15mg/kg/h until end of surgery, then every 4hours until 16±2hours after surgery). D-dimers, euglobulin lysis time (ELT), and thrombin generation time (TGT) were measured prior to surgery as well as 6, 18 and 24hours (H) after.ResultsNo significant difference in ELT was observed between the groups. In contrast, D-dimers significantly increased postoperatively in patients not treated with TXA (p&lt;0.001), while such an increase was prevented in patients receiving TXA, as measured at H0, H6, H18 and H24 after THR, and at H6 and H18 after TKR (p&lt;0.001). No significant between-group change in TGT, was observed (peak thrombin and endogenous thrombin potential) all along the study.ConclusionThis study shows that fibrinolysis peaked 6hours after end of surgery and maintained about 18hours after surgery, as evidenced by an increase in D-dimers. When administered for up to 16±2hours after surgery, TXA reduced postoperative fibrinolysis."

Hyperfibrinolysis is associated with a doubling of mortality. Fibrinolysis shutdown, an acute impairment of fibrinolysis, has been recognized as a risk factor for increased mortality. The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence and outcomes of fibrinolysis phenotypes in 2 urban trauma centers.Study DesignInjured patients included in the analysis were admitted between 2010 and 2013, were 18 years of age or older, and had an Injury Severity Score (ISS) &gt; 15. Admission fibrinolysis phenotypes were determined by the clot lysis at 30 minutes (LY30): shutdown ≤ 0.8%, physiologic 0.9% to 2.9%, and hyperfibrinolysis ≥ 3%. Logistic regression was used to adjust for age, arrival blood pressure, ISS, mechanism, and facility.ResultsThere were 2,540 patients who met inclusion criteria. Median age was 39 years (interquartile range [IQR] 26 to 55 years) and median ISS was 25 (IQR 20 to 33), with a mortality rate of 21%. Fibrinolysis shutdown was the most common phenotype (46%) followed by physiologic (36%) and hyperfibrinolysis (18%). Hyperfibrinolysis was associated with the highest death rate (34%), followed by shutdown (22%), and physiologic (14%, p &lt; 0.001). The risk of mortality remained increased for hyperfibrinolysis (odds ratio [OR] 3.3, 95% CI 2.4 to 4.6, p &lt; 0.0001) and shutdown (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.1, p = 0.0003) compared with physiologic when adjusting for age, ISS, mechanism, head injury, and blood pressure (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve 0.82, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.84).ConclusionsFibrinolysis shutdown is the most common phenotype on admission and is associated with increased mortality. These data provide additional evidence of distinct phenotypes of coagulation impairment and that individualized hemostatic therapy may be required."

We investigated fibrinolytic changes during ovarian stimulation through a global test (CLT) and PAI-1 and TAFI concentrations at different times of ovarian stimulation procedure, and the influence of polymorphisms in genes encoding for fibrinogen chains (FGA, FGB, FGG), t-PA (PLAT), TAFI (CBP2), FXIII (FXIIA1, FXIIIB), plasminogen (PLG) and PAI-1 (PAI1) on their intermediate phenotype.Materials and methodsWe evaluated fibrinolytic and genetic parameters in 110 infertile women undergoing ovarian stimulation procedure (in vitro fertilization, IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection, ICSI). All women were observed during the mid-luteal phase of cycle (T0) and on day 5 (T1), 7 (T2) and 9 (T3) of the ovarian stimulation.ResultsSignificant changes in fibrinolytic parameters from T0 to T3 of ovarian stimulation were found (CLT p=0.003; TAFI p=0.009 and PAI-1 p=0.003). CLT values, TAFI and PAI-1 concentrations significantly increased from baseline to T1 (p&lt;0.0001, p=0.01, p=0.005, respectively), and decreased at T2, but remained higher than those at T0. Moreover, at baseline overweight women showed longer CLT, higher TAFI and PAI-1 concentrations than normal weight women, as well as at T1 two-fold longer CLT and higher PAI-1 concentrations were observed (p=0.001 and p=0.05, respectively). Significant differences of TAFI and PAI-1 concentrations during ovarian stimulation according to TAFI and PAI1 polymorphisms were observed.ConclusionsThis study shows alterations of fibrinolysis and suggests the contribution of TAFI and PAI1 genes in modulating fibrinolysis changes during the ovarian stimulation cycle."

The DIC was diagnosed based on the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM) DIC and the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) overt DIC criteria.ResultsThe JAAM DIC scores were independent predictors of patient death and MODS. The JAAM DIC patients, especially those who met the ISTH overt DIC criteria, showed lower TAFI activity, and higher levels of soluble fibrin, neutrophil elastase, fibrin degradation product by neutrophil elastase (EXDP), plasmin-alpha2 plasmin inhibitor complex (PPIC), tissue plasminogen activator-plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 complex (tPAIC) and D-dimer in comparison with non-DIC patients. There were differences in the levels of soluble fibrin, tPAIC, TAFI activity, and neutrophil elastase between the patients with and without MODS. However, no differences were observed in the levels of PPIC, D-dimer, or EXDP. Soluble fibrin negatively correlated with the TAFI activity. High neutrophil elastase, low TAFI activity and PPIC are independent predictors of patient death and MODS. tPAIC is an independent predictor of elevation of EXDP in DIC patients.ConclusionsActivation of fibrinolysis both by plasmin and neutrophil elastase cannot overcome fibrinolytic shutdown, leading to MODS and a poor outcome in sepsis-induced DIC. The systemic activation of neutrophils and a low TAFI activity are also involved in the pathogenesis of MODS."

The aim of the study was to explore the effect of TM on the cross-linking of α2-plasmin inhibitor (α2-PI) to fibrin in plasma samples of different FV genotypes and how this effect is related to the impaired fibrinolysis of FVLeiden carriers.MethodsIn the plasma samples of fifteen individuals with different FV genotypes and in FV deficient plasma supplemented with wild type FV or FVLeiden coagulation was initiated by recombinant human tissue factor and phospholipids with or without recombinant human TM (rhTM). In the recovered clots the extent of α2-PI-fibrin cross-linking was evaluated by Western blotting and quantitative densitometry. The effect of rhTM on tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) induced clot lysis was measured by turbidimetric method.ResultsrhTM significantly delayed the formation of α2-PI-fibrin α-chain heterodimers/oligomers in plasma samples containing wild type FV. This effect of rhTM was impaired in the presence of FVLeiden. rhTM delayed tPA-induced clot lysis and this effect of rhTM was more pronounced in plasma containing FVLeiden. When TAFIa was inhibited by potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor, rhTM accelerated clot lysis in the presence of wild type FV, which is explained by the delayed α2-PI-fibrin cross-linking. This effect of rhTM did not prevail in the presence of FVLeiden.ConclusionFVLeiden abrogates the delaying effect of rhTM on α2-PI-fibrin cross-linking, which contributes to the impaired fibrinolysis observed in FVLeiden carriers."

We sought to determine if any clinical or radiographic characteristics can help predict stroke mimics among IVF candidates.MethodsThis retrospective study was carried out at a single institution. Patients treated with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA; n = 193) were divided into 3 categories: acute ischemic stroke (n = 142), aborted stroke (n = 21), and stroke mimics (n = 30). Analysis of variance and the chi-square test were used to assess differences, while logistic regression models were computed to predict groups.ResultsMimics treated with rt-PA did not experience complications (intracranial bleeding, systemic hemorrhage, or angioedema), and had better neurologic and functional outcomes than stroke patients (P &lt; .05). Several variables helped differentiate strokes from mimics, including atherosclerosis on computed tomographic angiography (odds ratio [OR] 23.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.4-66.2), atrial fibrillation (OR 11.4; 95% CI 1.5-86.3), age &gt;50 years (OR 7.2; 95% CI 2.8-18.5), and focal weakness (OR 4.15; 95% CI 1.75-9.8). Other variables decreased chances of stroke: migraine history (OR 0.05; 95% CI 0.01-0.4), epilepsy (OR 0.13; 95% CI 0.02-0.8), paresthesia (OR 0.1; 95% CI 0.04-0.3), and precordialgia (OR 0.045; 95% CI 0.002-0.9). A regression model using focal weakness, computed tomographic angiography findings, and precordialgia had a 90.2% predictive accuracy.ConclusionsIVF has low complication rates in stroke mimics. Certain clinical characteristics appear predictive of stroke mimics, particularly normal computed tomographic angiography. If confirmed, this may help prevent giving IVF to patients without stroke."

One reason for this paradox is the inability to assign units of activity to plasminogen activators based on specific biologically relevant standards, which impairs objective comparison. Here, we compare clot permeation, retention and fibrinolytic activities of tPA, TNK and Ret in vitro and clot composition over time with outcome in a mouse model of disseminated pulmonary microembolism (ME). When clots were incubated in the continuous presence of drug, tPA, TNK and Ret lysed fibrin clots identically in the absence of PA inhibitor-1 (e.g. PAI-1). Ret, which has lower fibrin affinity and greater susceptibility to inhibition by PAI-1 than tPA, was less effective in lysing plasma clots, while TNK was less effective when the fibrin content of the clots was enhanced. However, when clots were afforded only brief exposure to drug, as occurs in vivo, Ret showed more extensive clot permeation, greater retention and lysis than tPA or TNK. These results were reproduced in vivo in a mouse model of ME. These studies indicate the need for more relevant tests of plasminogen activator activity in vitro and in vivo and they show that clot permeation and retention are important potential predictors of clinical utility."

The number of miscarriages was 2.59 and occurred at gestational age 6.89weeks. TAFI levels were determined by a chromogenic assay measuring total potential activatable TAFI.ResultsTAFI levels were significantly lower in early recurrent fetal loss women (12.2±2.3μg/ml vs 13.2±2.6μg/ml in healthy controls, p=0.001). ORs of early recurrent fetal loss (crude and adjusted for possible confounding variables) were calculated after stratification of TAFI levels into quartiles. 25/140 (17.8%) early recurrent fetal loss women had TAFI levels above 14.0μg/ml (4th quartile) vs 44/140 (31.3%) in healthy women (p=0.014). Crude and adjusted ORs of early recurrent fetal loss in women with TAFI levels in the 4th quartile vs those in the reference category (1st quartile=below 11.0μg/ml) were 0.42 (95%CI: 0.22-0.82) and 0.39 (95%CI: 0.19-0.80), respectively.ConclusionsOur study provides evidence that high TAFI levels are associated with reduced risk of early recurrent fetal loss. Further studies are needed to better understand the actual role of TAFI in recurrent fetal loss."
Anomalies constitutionnelles de la fibrinolyse et syndromes hémorragiques,"{'author': [{'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Hanss', 'given-name': 'Michel'}]}",June 2012,http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1773035X12715009,1-s2.0-S1773035X12715009,"RésuméLa fibrinolyse est l’ensemble des mécanismes cellulaires et plasmatiques permettant la destruction du thrombus, mais elle intervient aussi dans le développement tissulaire. Son dérèglement contribue à la survenue de pathologies thrombotiques et hémorragiques. Au niveau hémorragique, deux déficits en inhibiteur cliniquement pertinents ont pu être identifiés, le déficit en α2-antiplasmine et le déficit en PAI-1. Bien que leur symptomatologie soit variable, elle est assez similaire, tout comme les options thérapeutiques. Ils sont caractérisés par une fréquence très faible, ne sont pas repérés par des tests usuels ou simples et nécessitent donc une mesure spécifique qui n’est pas toujours effectuée. Ils se doivent d’être recherchés au moins dans les cas bien documentés de pathologie hémorragique persistante, après élimination des causes biologiques plus fréquentes comme une maladie de Willebrand, un déficit en facteur de la coagulation, une thrombocytopathie. En effet la sanction thérapeutique est simple, ainsi que la recherche chez les apparentés.SummaryFibrinolysis is known as the plasma and cellular mechanisms leading to destruction of the blood clot, but it is also involved in tissue development. Its dysregulation can contribute to the occurrence of thrombosis and bleeding. For bleeding, two inhibitor deficiencies have been identified as clinically relevant, involving α2-antiplasmin and PAI-1. Although variable, the bleeding symptoms are similar, as are treatment options. Both deficiencies are characterized by a very low occurrence rate, are not detected by current hemostasis evaluation and therefore require specific measurements which are not always performed. They need to be sought at least in well documented cases of persistent hemorrhagic profile once more frequent biological causes have been set aside like von Willebrand disease, a coagulation factor deficiency, thrombocytopathy. Once this diagnosis has been performed, the treatment options are simple, and evaluation of the relatives is needed."

Phosphocholine (PC)-containing OxPL (OxPC) present on plasminogen were detected directly with liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and immunologically with monoclonal antibody E06. In vitro clot lysis assays were performed to assess the effect of the OxPL on plasminogen on fibrinolysis.ResultsLC-MS/MS revealed that OxPC fragments were covalently bound to mouse plasminogen. Immunoblot, immunoprecipitation, density gradient ultracentrifugation, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses demonstrated that all human and animal plasma samples tested contained OxPL covalently bound to plasminogen. In plasma samples subjected to density gradient fractionation, OxPL were present on plasminogen (OxPL/plasminogen) in non-lipoprotein fractions but on Lp(a) in lipoprotein fractions. Plasma levels of OxPL/apoB and OxPL/apo(a) varied significantly (&gt;25×) among subjects and also strongly correlated with Lp(a) levels. In contrast, OxPL/plasminogen levels were distributed across a relatively narrow range and did not correlate with Lp(a). Enzymatic removal of OxPL from plasminogen resulted in a longer lysis time for fibrin clots (16.25 vs. 11.96 min, p = 0.007). In serial measurements over 7 months, OxPL/plasminogen levels did not vary in normal subjects or in patients with stable CVD, but increased acutely over the first month and then slowly decreased to baseline in patients following AMI.ConclusionsThese data demonstrate that plasminogen contains covalently bound OxPL that influence fibrinolysis. OxPL/plasminogen represent a second major plasma pool of OxPL, in addition to those present on Lp(a). OxPL present on plasminogen may have pathophysiological implications in AMI and atherothrombosis."

Compelling evidence indicates that thrombin, either alone or in complex with thrombomodulin, is the main physiological activator of TAFI. For this reason derangements of thrombin formation, whatever the cause, may influence the fibrinolytic process too. Experimental models of thrombosis suggest that TAFI may participate in thrombus development and persistence under certain circumstances. In several models of pharmacological thrombolysis, the administration of TAFI inhibitors along with the fibrinolytic agent leads to a marked improvement of thrombus lysis, underscoring the potential of TAFI inhibitors as adjuvants for thrombolytic therapy. The role of TAFI in inflammatory diseases is more complex as it may serve as a defense mechanism, exacerbate the disease, or have no influence, depending on the nature of the model and the role played by the mediators controlled by TAFIa. Finally, the numerous clinical studies in patients with thrombotic disease support the idea that increased levels of TAFI and/or the enhancement of TAFI activation may represent a new risk factor for venous and arterial thrombosis."

Major cardiac outcomes were reduced with antiplatele therapy intensification, but with increased risk of bleeding Our objective was to assess the risk of vascular bleeding in patients undergoing early percutaneous coronary intervention after thrombolysis.MethodsBetween February 2010 and December 2011, five public emergency rooms in the city of São Paulo and the Emergency Health Care Service (Serviço de Atendimento Móvel de Urgência – SAMU) used tenecteplas (TNK) to treat patients with STEMI. Patients were referred to a single tertiary hospital and were submitted to early cardiacatheterization during hospitalization. All examinations werperformed via the femoral artery and BARC criteria were useto classify bleeding.ResultsWe evaluated 199 patients, of whom 193 had no bleeding of vascular origin (group 1) and 6 (3%) developed this complication (group 2). The median time between the administration of the fibrinolytic agent and catheterization was 24 hours in group 1 and 14.7hours in group 2. According to BARC criteria, 1 patient had type 3a bleeding (hematoma in the inguinal region with a hemoglobin decrease of 3–5g/dL), 2 patients had type 3b bleeding (1 not related to vascular access and 1 retroperitoneal hematom with a hemoglobin decrease≥5g/dL) and the remaining patients had type 1 bleeding (small inguinal hematomas). Blood transfusions were required in 2 patients. None of the patients died due to vascular complications after the intervention.ConclusionsIn our study, early catheterization via the femoral artery as part of a pharmaco-invasive strategy, using TNK as a fibrinolytic agent, had a low vascular bleeding rate, comparable to that of elective angioplasties."

Many emerging studies have begun to unravel the pathophysiologic role of the fibrinolytic system in breast cancer (BC) progression (Zorio et al., 2008) [2]. Activation of the fibrinolytic plasminogen/plasmin system results in degradation of protein barriers, thereby mediating cell migration essential for tumor growth, angiogenesis, and dissemination (Castellino and Ploplis, 2005) [3]. In the current study, in silico data analysis of Thrombin-Activatable Fibrinolysis Inhibitor (TAFI) gene and protein has been done. Data have been retrieved from several databases mentioned in details in the text. Determination and analysis of the structural and functional impact of TAFI and its expression could help elucidate the contribution of the TAFI pathway to acquired hemostatic dysfunction and will form the basis of potential therapeutic strategies to manipulate this pathway. An inhibition of TAFI (e.g. by FXI inhibitors) will offer the therapeutic possibilities to improve the decreased fibrinolysis and increase the efficiency of fibrinolytic therapy in thrombotic disorders including cancer."

Plasma coagulative and fibrinolytic potentials in normal children and adults, and in representative pathologically altered hemostatic states, were evaluated via simultaneous assessment of thrombin and plasmin generation.Materials and MethodsAn assay of Simultaneous Thrombin and Plasmin generation (STP) was developed to measure thrombin and plasmin in plasma using individual fluorometric substrates. Coagulation is initiated with dilute tissue factor, phospholipid, and calcium in platelet-poor plasma; fibrinolysis is accelerated via tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Abnormal states of hemostasis were investigated.ResultsSTP assay reproducibility and normal adult and pediatric values for measured and calculated parameters have been established. Onset of both thrombin and plasmin generation was significantly delayed in children relative to adults (p&lt;0.001) and the maximum amplitudes of thrombin and plasmin generation were less in children than adults (p&lt;0.01). No significant differences were measured among pediatric age groups. The most profound impairments in thrombin generation were observed for extrinsic and common pathway factor deficiencies, with the exception of afibrinogenemia. Plasmin generation was severely impaired in deficiencies of fibrinogen and plasminogen as well as with decreased tPA reagent concentration and addition of aminocaproic acid. Plasmin generation was greatly enhanced by alpha-2-antiplasmin deficiency and excess tPA reagent.ConclusionSimultaneous assessment of thrombin and plasmin generation in plasma shows promise for affording an enhanced understanding of overall coagulative and fibrinolytic functions in physiological and pathologically altered states of hemostasis in children and adults."

Fibrin formation in the samples was triggered by addition of tissue factor (1pmol/L) and washed frozen-thawed platelets obtained from a healthy donor. The permeability constant (Ks), which reflects fibrin network permeability, was then calculated from liquid flow measurements. A global assay newly developed in our group was also employed to determine the balance between fibrin formation (“Coagulation profile”; Cp) and fibrin degradation (“Fibrinolysis profile”; Fp) in the same samples. We also measured PAI-1 antigen and fibrinogen concentrations in plasma.ResultsAs compared to controls, the stroke patients had lower Ks (lower fibrin network permeability) both on day 1 and on day 60 (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.05, respectively). Fibrinolysis, assessed by Fp, was reduced on both day 1 and day 60 (p&lt;0.001, compared to controls), and PAI-1 concentrations were increased (p&lt;0.01 for both, compared to controls). Fibrin formation capacity in plasma (i.e. Cp) was increased in the acute phase (p&lt;0.05) but not in the convalescence, as compared to controls.ConclusionThe combination of a proneness to form a tighter fibrin network and impaired fibrinolysis is a feature of ischemic stroke that is present in both the acute and convalescent phase of the disease."

Animal models have not reproduced these changes. We hypothesize rodents have a shutdown phenotype that require an exogenous profibrinolytic to differentiate mechanisms that promote or inhibit fibrinolysis.MethodsFibrinolysis resistance was assessed by thrombelastography (TEG) using exogenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) titrations in whole blood. There were 3 experimental groups: (1) tissue injury (laparotomy/bowel crush), (2) shock (hemorrhage to mean arterial pressure of 20 mmHg), and (3) control (arterial cannulation and tracheostomy). Baseline and 30-minute postintervention blood samples were collected, and assayed with TEG challenged with taurocholic acid (TUCA).ResultsRats were resistant to exogenous tPA; the percent clot remaining 30 minutes after maximum amplitude (CL30) at 150 ng/mL (P = .511) and 300 ng/mL (P = .931) was similar to baseline, whereas 600 ng/mL (P = .046) provoked fibrinolysis. Using the TUCA challenge, the percent change in CL30 from baseline was increased in tissue injury compared with control (P = .048.), whereas CL30 decreased in shock versus control (P = .048). tPA increased in the shock group compared with tissue injury (P = .009) and control (P = .012).ConclusionRats have an innate fibrinolysis shutdown phenotype. The TEG TUCA challenge is capable of differentiating changes in clot stability with rats undergoing different procedures. Tissue injury inhibits fibrinolysis, whereas shock promotes tPA-mediated fibrinolysis."

Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) has been identified as an important inhibitor of fibrinolysis. The aim of our study was to assess the role of TAFI in young patients with peripheral arterial disease.MethodsIn a single-center case-control study we measured plasma TAFI antigen levels and functional TAFI in consecutive young patients (men 18-45years and women 18-55years) with a first manifestation of peripheral arterial disease and compared these with a population-based control group.ResultsA total of 47 peripheral arterial disease patients and 141 controls (mean age 43) were included. Intact TAFI antigen levels were significantly higher in patients with peripheral arterial disease (112.4±21.1%) than in controls (104.9±19.9%, p=0.03). The risk of peripheral arterial disease increased with 18% (OR 1.18; CI 1.01-1.34) per 10% increase of TAFI antigen. Functional TAFI levels were slightly higher in patients compared to controls, however this difference was not significant. For individuals with the highest functional TAFI levels, above the 90th percentile, the increased risk for peripheral arterial disease was most pronounced (OR 3.1; CI 1.02-9.41).ConclusionHigh TAFI levels are associated with increased risk of premature peripheral arterial disease."
Prognostic Value of Plasma Fibrinolysis Activation Markers in Cardiovascular Disease,"{'author': [{'@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Gorog', 'given-name': 'Diana A.'}]}",15 June 2010,http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735109710013446,1-s2.0-S0735109710013446,"The pivotal role of hypoactive endogenous fibrinolysis in the occurrence of thrombotic cardiovascular events is now well-recognized. To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic role of impaired fibrinolysis, plasma fibrinolysis markers have been investigated in large prospective studies in both healthy individuals and patients with established coronary disease. Antigen and activity levels of components of the fibrinolytic system were measured by immunoassays, which replaced earlier global fibrinolysis tests. This review covers 45 studies in nearly 50,000 subjects, examining the association between plasma markers of fibrinolysis and coronary artery disease, to establish the usefulness of these markers in predicting future cardiovascular events. The predictive value of plasma levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator, platelet activator inhibitor-1, plasmin-antiplasmin complex, D-dimer, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, and lipoprotein(a) for major adverse cardiac events is highly variable and conflicting, especially after adjusting for conventional risk factors, judging from the published data in the last decade. The value of fibrinolysis activity markers is very limited in aiding diagnosis and risk stratification in the individual patient, on the basis of the weak prognostic values obtained in some studies and the lack of power in others. The physiological limitations of such markers in reflecting endogenous fibrinolysis is discussed. The emerging novel global assays of fibrinolysis will require large-scale clinical trials before their prognostic power or superiority to multiple biomarker measurements can be evaluated."

Fibrinogen was measured by the Clauss method in plasma and factor XIII (FXIII) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Turbidity measurements were used to assess clot lysis in plasma, and fibrinolysis in non-cross-linked and cross-linked fibrin. D-dimer was measured by VIDAS®, STA®Liatest® and AxSYM® assays.ResultsStrong clots were formed at low sclerosant concentrations (0.075–0.1%). At midrange concentrations (0.15% STS, 0.15–0.3% POL), both agents inhibited the contribution of platelets to clot firmness and formed weak clots prone to lysis. At higher concentrations (STS ≥0.3% and POL ≥0.6%), clot formation was inhibited. STS destroyed FXIII at ≥0.15% and fibrinogen at ≥0.6%. Neither sclerosant had a significant effect on cross-linked fibrin, but STS had a lytic effect on non-cross-linked fibrin. STS caused an artefactual elevation of D-dimer in the VIDAS® assay when fibrinogen was present.ConclusionDetergent sclerosants demonstrated a trimodal effect on clot formation, initiating strong clots at low concentrations, weak clots at midrange concentrations and preventing clot formation at higher concentrations. Neither agent had fibrinolytic activity."

Pre-operatively and 24 h post-operatively we measured PT–INR, aPTT, FDP, d-dimer, and fibrinogen. Color Doppler scan of the lower extremity was performed the 1st post-operative day. Differences before and after surgery were analyzed with respect to risk factors.ResultsNo clinically or ultrasound evident DVT was observed. INR (1.04 ± 0.06 vs. 1.12 ± 0.11, p &lt; 0.0001), d-dimer (0.38 ± 0.36 vs. 0.9 ± 0.64, p &lt; 0.0001), plasma fibrinogen (380.8 ± 74.9 vs. 403.8 ± 78.8, p = 0.0001) and FDP positivity exhibited statistically significant increase after surgery. The levels of aPTT did not exhibit any significant change. Concerning d-dimer, older age was associated with higher pre-operative concentrations; older patients accordingly exhibited more intense increase in d-dimer and FDP positivity after surgery. Male sex was associated with higher PT–INR and aPTT before surgery, as well as with more pronounced increase in PT- INR postoperatively; similarly, older age was associated only with higher PT–INR before surgery.ConclusionsDespite no DVT, significant increase in PT–INR, d-dimer, FDP and fibrinogen appeared after LC. This may be attributed to surgical trauma and pneumoperitoneum effects on the portal vein flow. Elderly subjects and males seem particularly vulnerable, demonstrating more sizeable changes."
