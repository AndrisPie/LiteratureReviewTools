Contribution of arterial Windkessel in low-frequency cerebral hemodynamics during transient changes in blood pressure.,"The Windkessel properties of the vasculature are known to play a significant role in buffering arterial pulsations, but their potential importance in dampening low-frequency fluctuations in cerebral blood flow has not been clearly examined. In this study, we quantitatively assessed the contribution of arterial Windkessel (peripheral compliance and resistance) in the dynamic cerebral blood flow response to relatively large and acute changes in blood pressure. Middle cerebral artery flow velocity (MCA(V); transcranial Doppler) and arterial blood pressure were recorded from 14 healthy subjects. Low-pass-filtered pressure-flow responses (<0.15 Hz) during transient hypertension (intravenous phenylephrine) and hypotension (intravenous sodium nitroprusside) were fitted to a two-element Windkessel model. The Windkessel model was found to provide a superior goodness of fit to the MCA(V) responses during both hypertension and hypotension (R² = 0.89 ± 0.03 and 0.85 ± 0.05, respectively), with a significant improvement in adjusted coefficients of determination (P < 0.005) compared with the single-resistance model (R² = 0.62 ± 0.06 and 0.61 ± 0.08, respectively). No differences were found between the two interventions in the Windkessel capacitive and resistive gains, suggesting similar vascular properties during pressure rise and fall episodes. The results highlight that low-frequency cerebral hemodynamic responses to transient hypertension and hypotension may include a significant contribution from the mechanical properties of vasculature and, thus, cannot solely be attributed to the active control of vascular tone by cerebral autoregulation. The arterial Windkessel should be regarded as an important element of dynamic cerebral blood flow modulation during large and acute blood pressure perturbation.",2011,"['Chan, Gregory S H', 'Ainslie, Philip N', 'Willie, Chris K', 'Taylor, Chloe E', 'Atkinson, Greg', 'Jones, Helen', 'Lovell, Nigel H', 'Tzeng, Yu-Chieh']"
Fundamental relationships between blood pressure and cerebral blood flow in humans.,"Cerebral blood flow responses to transient blood pressure challenges are frequently attributed to cerebral autoregulation (CA), yet accumulating evidence indicates vascular properties like compliance are also influential. We hypothesized that middle cerebral blood velocity (MCAv) dynamics during or following a transient blood pressure perturbation can be accurately explained by the windkessel mechanism. Eighteen volunteers underwent blood pressure manipulations, including bilateral thigh-cuff deflation and sit-to-stand maneuvers under normocapnic and hypercapnic (5% CO2) conditions. Pressure-flow recordings were analyzed using a windkessel analysis approach that partitions the frequency-dependent resistance and compliance contributions to MCAv dynamics. The windkessel was typically able to explain more than 50% of the MCAv variance, as indicated by R(2) values for both the flow recovery and postrecovery phase. The most consistent predictors of MCAv dynamics under the control condition were the windkessel capacitive gain and high-frequency resistive gain. However, there were significant interindividual variations in the composition of windkessel predictors. Hypercapnia consistently reduced the capacitive gain and enhanced the low-frequency (0.04-0.20 Hz) resistive gain for both thigh-cuff deflation and sit-to-stand trials. These findings indicate that 1) MCAv dynamics during acute transient hypotension challenges are dominated by cerebrovascular windkessel properties independent of CA; 2) there is significant heterogeneity in windkessel properties between individuals; and 3) hemodynamic effects of hypercapnia during transient blood pressure challenges primarily reflect changes in windkessel properties rather than pure CA impairment.",2014,"['Tzeng, Y C', 'MacRae, B A', 'Ainslie, P N', 'Chan, G S H']"
Dynamic pressure-flow relationship of the cerebral circulation during acute increase in arterial pressure.,"The physiological mechanism(s) for the regulation of the dynamic pressure-flow relationship of the cerebral circulation are not well understood. We studied the effects of acute cerebral vasoconstriction on the transfer function between spontaneous changes in blood pressure (BP) and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in 13 healthy subjects (30 +/- 7 years). CBFV was measured in the middle cerebral artery using transcranial Doppler. BP was increased stepwise with phenylephrine infusion at 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 microg kg(-1) min(-1). Phenylephrine increased BP by 11, 23 and 37% from baseline, while CBFV increased (11%) only with the highest increase in BP. Cerebrovascular resistance index (BP/CBFV) increased progressively by 6, 17 and 23%, demonstrating effective steady-state autoregulation. Transfer function gain at the low frequencies (LF, 0.07-0.20 Hz) was reduced by 15, 14 and 14%, while the phase was reduced by 10, 17 and 31%. A similar trend of changes was observed at the high frequencies (HF, 0.20-0.35 Hz), but gain and phase remained unchanged at the very low frequencies (VLF, 0.02-0.07 Hz). Windkessel model simulation suggests that increases in steady-state cerebrovascular resistance and/or decreases in vascular compliance during cerebral vasoconstriction contribute to the changes in gain and phase. These findings suggest that changes in steady-state cerebrovascular resistance and/or vascular compliance modulate the dynamic pressure-flow relationship at the low and high frequencies, while dynamic autoregulation is likely to be dominant at the very low frequencies. Thus, oscillations in CBFV are modulated not only by dynamic autoregulation, but also by changes in steady-state cerebrovascular resistance and/or vascular compliance.",2009,"['Zhang, Rong', 'Behbehani, Khosrow', 'Levine, Benjamin D']"
Determinants of human cerebral pressure-flow velocity relationships: new insights from vascular modelling and Ca²⁺ channel blockade.,"The fundamental determinants of human dynamic cerebral autoregulation are poorly understood, particularly the role of vascular compliance and the myogenic response. We sought to 1) determine whether capacitive blood flow associated with vascular compliance and driven by the rate of change in mean arterial blood pressure (dMAP/dt) is an important determinant of middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAv) dynamics and 2) characterise the impact of myogenic blockade on these cerebral pressure-flow velocity relations in humans. We measured MCAv and mean arterial pressure (MAP) during oscillatory lower body negative pressure (n =8) at 0.10 and 0.05 Hz before and after cerebral Ca²⁺ channel blockade (nimodipine). Pressure-flow velocity relationships were characterised using transfer function analysis and a regression-based Windkessel analysis that incorporates MAP and dMAP/dt as predictors of MCAv dynamics. Results show that incorporation of dMAP/dt accounted for more MCAv variance (R² 0.80-0.99) than if only MAP was considered (R2 0.05-0.90). The capacitive gain relating dMAP/dt and MCAv was strongly correlated to transfer function gain (0.05 Hz, r =0.93, P<0.01; 0.10 Hz, r =0.91, P<0.01), but not to phase or coherence. Ca²⁺ channel blockade increased the conductive gain relation between MAP and MCAv (P<0.05), and reduced phase at 0.05 Hz (P<0.01). Capacitive and transfer function gain were unaltered. The findings suggest capacitive blood flow is an important determinant of cerebral haemodynamics that bears strong relations to some metrics of dynamic cerebral autoregulation derived from transfer function analysis, and that Ca²⁺ channel blockade enhances pressure-driven resistive blood flow but does not alter capacitive blood flow. the causes and effects of cerebrovascular diseases such as stroke and dementia.",2011,"['Tzeng, Yu-Chieh', 'Chan, Gregory S H', 'Willie, Christopher K', 'Ainslie, Philip N']"
Noninvasive monitoring of cerebral perfusion pressure in patients with acute liver failure using transcranial doppler ultrasonography.,"Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) leads to loss of cerebral perfusion, cerebral herniation, and irreversible brain damage in patients with acute liver failure (ALF). Conventional techniques for monitoring ICP can be complicated by hemorrhage and infection. Transcranial doppler ultrasonography (TCD) is a noninvasive device which can continuously measure cerebral blood flow velocity, producing a velocity-time waveform that indirectly monitors changes in cerebral hemodynamics, including ICP. The primary goal of this study was to determine whether TCD waveform features could be used to differentiate ALF patients with respect to ICP or, equally important, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) levels. A retrospective study of 16 ALF subjects with simultaneous TCD, ICP, and CPP measurements yielded a total of 209 coupled ICP-CPP-TCD observations. The TCD waveforms were digitally scanned and seven points corresponding to a simplified linear waveform were identified. TCD waveform features including velocity, pulsatility index, resistive index, fraction of the cycle in systole, slopes, and angles associated with changes in the slope in each region, were calculated from the simplified waveform data. Paired ICP-TCD observations were divided into three groups (ICP < 20 mmHg, n = 102; 20 < or = ICP < 30 mmHg, n = 74; and ICP > or = 30 mmHg, n = 33). Paired CPP-TCD observations were also divided into three groups (CPP > or = 80 mmHg, n = 42; 80 > CPP > or = 60 mmHg, n = 111; and CPP < 60 mmHg, n = 56). Stepwise linear discriminant analysis was used to identify TCD waveform features that discriminate between ICP groups and CPP groups. Four primary features were found to discriminate between ICP groups: the blood velocity at the start of the Windkessel effect, the slope of the Windkessel upstroke, the angle between the end systolic downstroke and start diastolic upstroke, and the fraction of time spent in systole. Likewise, 4 features were found to discriminate between the CPP groups: the slope of the Windkessel upstroke, the slope of the Windkessel downstroke, the slope of the diastolic downstroke, and the angle between the end systolic downstroke and start diastolic upstroke. The TCD waveform captures the cerebral hemodynamic state and can be used to predict dynamic changes in ICP or CPP in patients with ALF. The mean TCD waveforms for corresponding, correctly classified ICP and CPP groups are remarkably similar. However, this approach to predicting intracranial hypertension and CPP needs to be further refined and developed before clinical application is feasible.",2008,"['Aggarwal, Shushma', 'Brooks, David M', 'Kang, Yoogoo', 'Linden, Peter K', 'Patzer, John F']"
The influence of central arterial compliance on cerebrovascular hemodynamics: insights from endurance training intervention.,"Normally, central elastic arteries (e.g., aorta and common carotid artery) effectively buffer cardiac pulsation-induced flow/pressure fluctuations. With advancing age, arterial stiffening deteriorates this function and produces the greater cerebral hemodynamic pulsatility that impacts vulnerable brain tissue. It is well known that the buffering function of the central artery is improved by regular aerobic exercise, but the influence of endurance training on the pulsatile component of cerebral hemodynamics remains poorly understood. To characterize the functional role of the central artery at the heart-brain hemodynamic connection comprehensively, we assessed relations among the endurance training-induced changes in the left ventricle (LV), carotid arterial compliance, and cerebral hemodynamics. Thirteen collegiate tennis players (20 ± 1 yr) underwent a 16-wk endurance training intervention designed for improving cardiovascular function. Expectedly, maximal oxygen uptake (V̇o2peak), LV ejection velocity (via Doppler ultrasound), and the maximal rate of pressure increase of estimated aortic pressure waveform (via general transfer function) improved after the training intervention, whereas middle cerebral arterial (MCA) hemodynamics (via transcranial Doppler), such as mean and pulsatile flow velocities, remained unchanged. Carotid arterial compliance (via ultrasound and applanation tonometry) increased after the training intervention, and a larger increase in carotid arterial compliance was significantly associated with the greater attenuations of pulsatile MCA velocity (r = -0.621) normalized by mean MCA velocity. These results suggest that the training-induced improvement of carotid artery Windkessel function might offset the expected increase in the pulsatile component of cerebral perfusion induced by the enhanced LV systolic function.",2015,"['Tomoto, Tsubasa', 'Sugawara, Jun', 'Nogami, Yoshie', 'Aonuma, Kazutaka', 'Maeda, Seiji']"
Dynamics of cerebral blood flow regulation explained using a lumped parameter model.,"The dynamic cerebral blood flow response to sudden hypotension during posture change is poorly understood. To better understand the cardiovascular response to hypotension, we used a windkessel model with two resistors and a capacitor to reproduce beat-to-beat changes in middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (transcranial Doppler measurements) in response to arterial pressure changes measured in the finger (Finapres). The resistors represent lumped systemic and peripheral resistances in the cerebral vasculature, whereas the capacitor represents a lumped systemic compliance. Ten healthy young subjects were studied during posture change from sitting to standing. Dynamic variations of the peripheral and systemic resistances were extracted from the data on a beat-to-beat basis. The model shows an initial increase, followed approximately 10 s later by a decline in cerebrovascular resistance. The model also suggests that the initial increase in cerebrovascular resistance can explain the widening of the cerebral blood flow pulse observed in young subjects. This biphasic change in cerebrovascular resistance is consistent with an initial vasoconstriction, followed by cerebral autoregulatory vasodilation.",2002,"['Olufsen, Mette S', 'Nadim, Ali', 'Lipsitz, Lewis A']"
"Dynamic cerebral autoregulation in subjects with Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and controls: evidence for increased peripheral vascular resistance with possible predictive value.","Cerebrovascular dysfunction plays a role not only in vascular causes of cognitive impairment but also in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We hypothesized that cerebral autoregulation is impaired in patients with AD compared to subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and controls. Dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) was investigated in 17 AD patients, 19 MCI subjects, and 20 controls (C). Groups were matched for age, gender, and level of education. Electrocardiogram and non-invasive finger arterial blood pressure were measured and transcranial doppler ultrasonography was used to measure cerebral blood flow velocity in right and left middle cerebral artery (MCA). Cerebrovascular resistance index (CVRi) was also computed. dCA in supine position was quantified based on spontaneous blood pressure variations by computation of the linear transfer function between arterial blood pressure and MCA cerebral blood flow velocity. dCA gain and phase were evaluated for different frequency bands. Results were also evaluated using a 3-parameter windkessel model (WKM). CVRi was significantly higher in AD (2.9 ± 0.2) compared to both MCI (2.3 ± 0.1, p = 0.02) and C (2.1 ± 0.1 mmHgs/cm, p = 0.002). Five MCI patients who converted to AD during the course of the study also had higher CVRi compared to non-converters (2.8 ± 0.6 versus 2.1 ± 0.5 mmHgs/cm, p < 0.05). No significant differences in dCA gain and phase were found. In terms of the WKM approach, in the order C→MCI→AD groups showed about equal arterial resistance and peripheral compliance, but increased peripheral vasculature resistance (26 ± 2 versus 36 ± 3 mmHgs/ml in C resp. AD, p = 0.004). In conclusion, AD patients compared to MCI patients and controls have increased CVRi, whereas dCA parameters do not seem to differentiate AD patients. For MCI patients, CVRi might have predictive value in developing AD.",2012,"['Gommer, Erik D', 'Martens, Esther G H J', 'Aalten, Pauline', 'Shijaku, Eri', 'Verhey, Frans R J', 'Mess, Werner H', 'Ramakers, Inez H G B', 'Reulen, Jos P H']"
An impedance index in normal subjects and in subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"The impedance of a hemodynamic system is defined as the ratio of each harmonic component of blood pressure to that of flow. Calculation of impedance cures has been extensively performed in the systemic circulation, leading to the recognition of reflected pressure and flow waves and clarifying the shape of ultrasound waveforms. Impedance in the human cerebral circulation has not been measured primarily because of the relative inaccessibility of simultaneous flow and pressure data in the human cerebral circulation. We defined an impedance index using the transcranial Doppler waveform for that of flow and a noninvasive applanation measure of the carotid artery pressure waveform. Middle cerebral artery velocities and carotid artery pressure waveforms were simultaneously recorded in 16 vessels from 10 normal volunteers, 42 vessels in 14 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 14 vessels in 7 subjects during conditions of hypocapnia, normocapnia and hypercapnia. Impedance was calculated by dividing the harmonic associated with pressure divided by that of flow, and averaging 10 to 20 such calculations. Relative impedance curves were calculated by dividing by the impedance at the first harmonic. Impedance was also studied in an electrical model consisting of a Windkessel element containing inductance in series with a second Windkessel to model the large vessel and vascular bed, respectively. Model parameters were taken from the literature for these calculations. For the normal subjects, the shape of the impedance index curve was similar to those found in the systemic circulation. The impedance index curves for patients in vasospasm (middle cerebral velocity was greater than 180) showed a peak at the second or third harmonic, which appeared more frequently than the nonspasm group (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the ratio of the second harmonic to the first harmonic was significantly > 1.0 in the spasm group but significantly < 1.0 in the normal group (p < 0.05). Calculations from the electrical model replicated the appearance of these peaks at the second or third harmonic for vasospasm parameters. A statistically significant peak appeared at the second or third harmonic in the impedance index curves for patients in vasospasm, which was replicated quantitatively by our electrical model. Although such peaks can be explained in the systemic circulation by the presence of reflected waves, the distance to the reflection site is larger than expected for the cerebral circulation. This suggests the importance of the inertia of blood as a stenosis worsens and as the origin for the observed changes in the impedance index curves.",1996,"['Giller, C A', 'Ratcliff, B', 'Berger, B', 'Giller, A']"
[Significance of sports for the heart of the elderly].,"The changes in performance of cardiopulmonary metabolic parameters during aging are discussed. With advancing age, maximal oxygen uptake, the aerobic-anaerobic threshold, maximal attainable pulse rate, maximal stroke volume, and maximal peak flow all decrease. The causes are a reduction in the windkessel function of the aorta, loss of elasticity in the arteries, and silting of the peripheral capillaries, as well as other unidentified factors. The lower the aerobic-anaerobic threshold, the greater the reduction in blood flow through the liver and kidneys at given levels of load. This applies particularly to older individuals. The pulmonary circulation increases in inverse proportion to the maximal oxygen uptake value at submaximal load. Cerebral blood flow increases highly significantly in all parts of the left hemisphere at a measured work load of only 25 W, and the further increase at 100 W is again significant. The increase is greater in the gray matter than in the white matter. The maximal minute volume under load runs parallel to the maximal oxygen uptake curve with increasing age. Simultaneously, maximal diffusion capacity decreases and there is a reduction in the quality of distribution and perfusion. The result is an age-related decline of partial oxygen pressure in arterial blood. With advancing age there is an earlier rise in blood catecholamine levels, whereas the density of adrenoreceptors apparently changes only slightly, although their sensitivity decreases. Essentially, 55- to 70-year-old subjects who have gone for decades with no training are as trainable as untrained subjects in the third decade of life. This is true for all the parameter mentioned above. In contrast to younger subjects, muscle biopsies show an increase in activity not only of oxidative enzymes, but also of anaerobic enzymes (e.g., LDH). There is no increase in heart size after 8-12 weeks training. At rest and at given loads, there is an increase in stroke volume accompanied by a reduction in heart rate; peripheral resistance also decreases significantly. The heart of an older person participating in active sport could be placed at risk by inadequate training, but possibly also by excessive demands on intensity and duration.",1985,"['Hollmann, W', 'Rost, R', 'Liesen, H']"
