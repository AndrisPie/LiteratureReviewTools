Can the Windkessel Hypothesis Explain Delayed Intraparenchymal Haemorrhage After Flow Diversion? A Case Report and Model-Based Analysis of Possible Mechanisms,"BackgroundDelayed ipsilateral intraparenchymal haemorrhage is a recently recognised complication after endovascular flow diversion for intracranial aneurysms. Although the mechanism of this phenomenon is not understood, one proposed explanation (the windkessel hypothesis) is that removal of aneurysmal compliance increases distal pulse pressure.MethodsWe present a case of delayed haemorrhage after placement of a Pipeline stent, discuss the proposed mechanisms, and describe a novel electrical analogue model that was used to evaluate the likely haemodynamic effect of stent placement.ResultsModel-based analysis suggests that stenting is not likely to produce a significant change in distal pulse pressure. Moreover, basic fluid dynamics principles suggest that a local reduction in disturbed flow in the region of the aneurysm could produce only a minor increase in distal pressure (a few mmHg), which is unlikely to be the main cause of the observed haemorrhage.ConclusionThe windkessel hypothesis is unlikely to explain the occurrence of delayed ipsilateral intraparenchymal haemorrhage after flow diversion; however, other mechanisms involving altered haemodynamics distal to the treated aneurysm may play a role. Further studies involving the assessment of haemodynamic changes after flow diversion would be useful to understand, and eventually mitigate, this currently unpredictable risk.",August 2015,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Alim P.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Mitha'}, {'given-name': 'Jonathan P.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Mynard'}, {'given-name': 'John A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Storwick'}, {'given-name': 'Zaher I.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Shivji'}, {'given-name': 'John H.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Wong'}, {'given-name': 'William', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Morrish'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1443950615000736,1-s2.0-S1443950615000736

Evaluation of blood flow velocity waveform in common carotid artery using multi-branched arterial segment model of human arteries,"AbstractArteriosclerosis is considered to be a major cause of cardiovascular diseases, which account for approximately 30% of the causes of death in the world. We have recently demonstrated a strong correlation between arteriosclerosis (arterial elasticity) and two characteristics: maximum systolic velocity (S1) and systolic second peak velocity (S2) of the common carotid artery flow velocity waveform (CCFVW). The CCFVW can be measured by using a small portable measuring device. However, there is currently no theoretical evidence supporting the causes of the relation between CCFVW and arterial elasticity, or the origin of the CCFVW characteristics. In this study, the arterial blood flow was simulated using a one-dimensional systemic arterial segments model of human artery in order to conduct a qualitative evaluation of the relationship between arterial elasticity and the characteristics of CCFVW. The simulation was carried out based on the discretized segments with the physical properties of a viscoelastic tube (the cross-sectional area at the proximal and terminal ends, the length, and the compliance per unit area of the tube (CS)). The findings obtained through this study revealed that the simulated CCFVW had shape similar characteristics to that of the measured CCFVW. Moreover, when the compliance CS of the model was decreased, the first peak of the simulated-CCFVW decreased and the second peak increased. Further, by separating the anterograde pulse wave and the reflected pulse wave, which form the CCFVW, we found that the decrease in the first peak of the simulated CCFVW was due to the arrival of a reflected pulse wave from the head after the common carotid artery toward the arrival of a anterograde pulse wave ejected directly from the heart and that the increase in the second peak resulted from the arrival of the peak of the reflected pulse wave from the thoracic aorta. These results establish that the CCFVW characteristics contribute to the assessment of arterial elasticity.",November 2013,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Masuda'}, {'given-name': 'T.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Emoto'}, {'given-name': 'A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Suzuki'}, {'given-name': 'M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Akutagawa'}, {'given-name': 'T.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kitawaki'}, {'given-name': 'K.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kitaoka'}, {'given-name': 'H.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Tanaka'}, {'given-name': 'S.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Obara'}, {'given-name': 'K.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Yoshizaki'}, {'given-name': 'S.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Konaka'}, {'given-name': 'Y.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kinouchi'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1746809413000797,1-s2.0-S1746809413000797

Carotid artery hemodynamics before and after stenting: A patient specific CFD study,"AbstractQuantitative assessment of the hemodynamic impact of carotid artery stenting (CAS) represents an important ingredient to understand the CAS long-term outcomes, which are still a matter of clinical debate. Although computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been extensively used for the biomechanical analysis of carotid arteries in healthy and stenotic conditions, there are few contributions in the literature dealing with post-stenting conditions because (i) current medical images do not have sufficient resolution to accurately reconstruct the stent geometry, and (ii) the generation of a body-fitted mesh of the stent-artery configuration is cumbersome. Motivated by these considerations, the present study proposes a numerical approach able to implicitly account for the stent geometry in the post-operative patient-specific hemodynamic CFD analysis by introducing velocity penalty terms in the weak form of the equations governing blood flow in arteries. Such an approach allows us to compare different patient-specific CAS scenarios, ranging from a healthy carotid to a post-stenting configuration after the treatment of a severe stenosis, and paves the way for rapid CFD-based investigations of the hemodynamic impact of novel endovascular devices with complex grid designs. Test computations as well as patient-specific CAS simulations are presented in this paper, with good results obtained in all cases.",15 December 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Michele', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Conti'}, {'given-name': 'Chris', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Long'}, {'given-name': 'Michele', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Marconi'}, {'given-name': 'Raffaella', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Berchiolli'}, {'given-name': 'Yuri', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bazilevs'}, {'given-name': 'Alessandro', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Reali'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0045793016301001,1-s2.0-S0045793016301001
Hemodynamic characterization of geometric cerebral aneurysm templates,"AbstractHemodynamics are currently considered to a lesser degree than geometry in clinical practices for evaluating cerebral aneurysm (CA) risk and planning CA treatment. This study establishes fundamental relationships between three clinically recognized CA geometric factors and four clinically relevant hemodynamic responses. The goal of the study is to develop a more combined geometric/hemodynamic basis for informing clinical decisions. Flows within eight idealized template geometries were simulated using computational fluid dynamics and measured using particle image velocimetry under both steady and pulsatile flow conditions. The geometric factor main effects were then analyzed to quantify contributions made by the geometric factors (aneurysmal dome size (DS), dome-to-neck ratio (DNR), and parent-vessel contact angle (PV-CA)) to effects on the hemodynamic responses (aneurysmal and neck-plane root-mean-square velocity magnitude (Vrms), aneurysmal wall shear stress (WSS), and cross-neck flow (CNF)). Two anatomical aneurysm models were also examined to investigate how well the idealized findings would translate to more realistic CA geometries. DNR made the greatest contributions to effects on hemodynamics including a 75.05% contribution to aneurysmal Vrms and greater than 35% contributions to all responses. DS made the next greatest contributions, including a 43.94% contribution to CNF and greater than 20% contributions to all responses. PV-CA and several factor interactions also made contributions of greater than 10%. The anatomical aneurysm models and the most similar idealized templates demonstrated consistent hemodynamic response patterns. This study demonstrates how individual geometric factors, and combinations thereof, influence CA hemodynamics. Bridging the gap between geometry and flow in this quantitative yet practical way may have potential to improve CA evaluation and treatment criteria. Agreement among results from idealized and anatomical models further supports the potential for a template-based approach to play a useful role in clinical practice.",26 July 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Priya', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Nair'}, {'given-name': 'Brian W.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Chong'}, {'given-name': 'Aprinda', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Indahlastari'}, {'given-name': 'James', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Lindsay'}, {'given-name': 'David', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'DeJeu'}, {'given-name': 'Varsha', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Parthasarathy'}, {'given-name': 'Justin', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ryan'}, {'given-name': 'Haithem', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Babiker'}, {'given-name': 'Christopher', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Workman'}, {'given-name': 'L.

Characteristics of Cerebral Hemodynamics in Patients with Ischemic Leukoaraiosis and New Ultrasound Indices of Ischemic Leukoaraiosis,"ObjectiveThe diagnosis of ischemic leukoaraiosis (ILA) is based on head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and exclusion of other causes of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). Recent studies have shown increased arterial stiffness and diminished carotid flow in ILA patients. So far, there are very little data on intracerebral hemodynamic parameters in ILA. Due to the specific structure of the intracranial arteries, our aim was to investigate intracerebral hemodynamic parameters in ILA patients and, possibly, to find a reliable ultrasound index of combined intra- and extracranial cerebral arteries.MethodsWe compared different hemodynamic parameters in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and local carotid stiffness parameters in 53 ILA patients to 40 gender and risk factor-matched controls with normal head MRI. The ILA diagnosis was based on head MRI and exclusion of other causes of WMH. In addition, we introduced new ischemic leukoariosis indices (ILAi) that are ratios of carotid stiffness parameters and MCA mean blood flow velocity. The diagnostic significance of ILAi for the prediction of ILA was analyzed.ResultsWe found significantly lower diastolic, systolic, and mean MCA blood flow velocities and increased carotid stiffness in the ILA group (P ≤ .05). All ILAi significantly differed between the groups (P &lt; .05), were significantly associated with ILA (P &lt; .01), and were sensitive and specific for predicting ILA (P &lt; .05).ConclusionMCA blood flow velocities in ILA patients are lower compared to risk factor-matched controls. A combination of lower velocities and increased carotid stiffness represented as ILAi could have a potential diagnostic value for ILA.",April 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Monika', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Turk'}, {'given-name': 'Marjan', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Zaletel'}, {'given-name': 'Janja', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Pretnar Oblak'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1052305716000124,1-s2.0-S1052305716000124
Wavelet transform analysis to assess oscillations in pial artery pulsation at the human cardiac frequency,"AbstractPial artery adjustments to changes in blood pressure (BP) may last only seconds in humans. Using a novel method called near-infrared transillumination backscattering sounding (NIR-T/BSS) that allows for the non-invasive measurement of pial artery pulsation (cc-TQ) in humans, we aimed to assess the relationship between spontaneous oscillations in BP and cc-TQ at frequencies between 0.5Hz and 5Hz. We hypothesized that analysis of very short data segments would enable the estimation of changes in the cardiac contribution to the BP vs. cc-TQ relationship during very rapid pial artery adjustments to external stimuli.BP and pial artery oscillations during baseline (70s and 10s signals) and the response to maximal breath-hold apnea were studied in eighteen healthy subjects. The cc-TQ was measured using NIR-T/BSS; cerebral blood flow velocity, the pulsatility index and the resistive index were measured using Doppler ultrasound of the left internal carotid artery; heart rate and beat-to-beat systolic and diastolic blood pressure were recorded using a Finometer; end-tidal CO2 was measured using a medical gas analyzer. Wavelet transform analysis was used to assess the relationship between BP and cc-TQ oscillations.The recordings lasting 10s and representing 10cycles with a frequency of ~1Hz provided sufficient accuracy with respect to wavelet coherence and wavelet phase coherence values and yielded similar results to those obtained from approximately 70cycles (70s). A slight but significant decrease in wavelet coherence between augmented BP and cc-TQ oscillations was observed by the end of apnea.Wavelet transform analysis can be used to assess the relationship between BP and cc-TQ oscillations at cardiac frequency using signals intervals as short as 10s. Apnea slightly decreases the contribution of cardiac activity to BP and cc-TQ oscillations.",May 2015,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'P.J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Winklewski'}, {'given-name': 'M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Gruszecki'}, {'given-name': 'J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Wolf'}, {'given-name': 'E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Swierblewska'}, {'given-name': 'K.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kunicka'}, {'given-name': 'M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Wszedybyl-Winklewska'}, {'given-name': 'W.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Guminski'}, {'given-name': 'J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Zabulewicz'}, {'given-name': 'A.F.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Frydrychowski'}, {'given-name': 'L.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bieniaszewski'}, {'given-name': 'K.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Narkiewicz'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0026286215000308,1-s2.0-S0026286215000308
A parameter estimation framework for patient-specific hemodynamic computations,"AbstractWe propose a fully automated parameter estimation framework for performing patient-specific hemodynamic computations in arterial models. To determine the personalized values of the windkessel models, which are used as part of the geometrical multiscale circulation model, a parameter estimation problem is formulated. Clinical measurements of pressure and/or flow-rate are imposed as constraints to formulate a nonlinear system of equations, whose fixed point solution is sought. A key feature of the proposed method is a warm-start to the optimization procedure, with better initial solution for the nonlinear system of equations, to reduce the number of iterations needed for the calibration of the geometrical multiscale models. To achieve these goals, the initial solution, computed with a lumped parameter model, is adapted before solving the parameter estimation problem for the geometrical multiscale circulation model: the resistance and the compliance of the circulation model are estimated and compensated.The proposed framework is evaluated on a patient-specific aortic model, a full body arterial model, and multiple idealized anatomical models representing different arterial segments. For each case it leads to the best performance in terms of number of iterations required for the computational model to be in close agreement with the clinical measurements.",15 January 2015,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Lucian', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Itu'}, {'given-name': 'Puneet', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sharma'}, {'given-name': 'Tiziano', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Passerini'}, {'given-name': 'Ali', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kamen'}, {'given-name': 'Constantin', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Suciu'}, {'given-name': 'Dorin', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Comaniciu'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021999114007165,1-s2.0-S0021999114007165

Nonlinear transcranial Doppler analysis demonstrates age-related changes of cerebral hemodynamics,"AbstractWe studied the age- and gender-related changes in complexity of arterial blood flow by analyzing the maximum velocity waveforms. Data were collected by insonation of the middle cerebral artery blood flow by a 2-MHz transcranial pulsed Doppler system. Following the paradigm of nonlinear dynamical systems or “chaos” theory, complexity is best evaluated by estimating the correlation dimension (D2) and the largest Lyapunov exponent (λ1). Forty healthy persons (male/female ratio: 11; mean age 48.6 y; range 19–86 y) were studied. No gender-related differences were observed. The age-effect showed a diminishing λ1 [df(1, 36) = 5.687; p &lt; 0.022] and an increasing D2 at higher age [df(1, 36) = 4.997; p &lt; 0.032]. The age-related decline of the λ1 implies a more prominent periodicity, explained by reduced fluctuations in R-R intervals and an altered gain of the baroreceptor reflex. The increased D2 might be related to more prominent vessel wall oscillations due to the increased vessel wall stiffness at higher age.",1996,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'R.W.M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Keunen'}, {'given-name': 'J.H.R.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Vliegen'}, {'given-name': 'C.J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Stam'}, {'given-name': 'D.L.J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Tavy'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/030156299600035X,1-s2.0-030156299600035X
Cerebral haemodynamics during thoracic- and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair,"Objective:To investigate cerebral haemodynamics during operations for thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms.Design:Prospective clinical study.Material:10 patients operated on consecutively with resection for thoracic (5) or thoracoabdominal aortic (5) aneurysms.Methods:Blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery was measured through a temporal approach using a TC Doppler with a 2 MHz probe. Recordings were made during induction of anaesthesia and performed continuously before, during and after cross-clamping of the aorta.Results:Following 10 min. of aortic cross-clamping blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery increased from 44 to 55 cm/s (p &lt; 0.01). A further increase to 69 cm/s (p &lt; 0.01) was observed 5 min after declamping. The pulsatility index averaged 0.74 increasing to 1.21 (p &lt; 0.05) at clamping and 0.87 (p &lt; 0.05) after declamping.Conclusion:There was an increased blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery during cross-clamping of the descending thoracic aorta in patients operated on for thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. This increase in cerebral blood flow and blood volume could explain the acute increase in cerebrospinal fluid pressure observed during cross-clamping of the thoracic aorta.",July 1996,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'O.D.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'S˦ther'}, {'given-name': 'R.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Juul'}, {'given-name': 'P.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Aadahl'}, {'given-name': 'T.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Strømholm'}, {'given-name': 'H.O.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Myhre'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078588496802802,1-s2.0-S1078588496802802
A Roe type energy balanced solver for 1D arterial blood flow and transport,"AbstractThe approximate solver presented in this work is based on the upwind discretization of the source terms and a genuinely Roe solver for the one-dimensional blood flow equations in arteries. This augmented solver involves the presence of the source terms, ensuring convergence to the exact solution by including an extra wave associated to the change in the material properties and the friction term. The resulting numerical scheme is energy-balanced, that is, ensures equilibrium in rest conditions and is able to ensure numerically a constant level of energy in steady cases with velocity. The resulting numerical solver allows simulating directly mass transport without creating non-physical oscillations. The numerical scheme is assessed using steady and unsteady problems with exact solutions and is compared with models of the systemic arterial tree published in literature.",31 August 2015,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Murillo'}, {'given-name': 'P.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'García-Navarro'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0045793015001504,1-s2.0-S0045793015001504
Incidence and Characteristics of Remote Intracerebral Hemorrhage After Endovascular Treatment of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms,"ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence and characteristics of remote intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) after endovascular treatment (EVT) of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs).MethodsBetween March 2007 and September 2015, 11 patients with remote ICH from a series of 2258 consecutive patients with 2597 UIAs treated via EVT were identified. Baseline demographic characteristics, medical history, radiologic imaging data, characteristics of remote ICH, and clinical outcomes were retrospectively reviewed. The characteristics of patients with remote ICH were compared with those of patients without remote ICH.ResultsAll hematomas were single lesions located in the subcortical white matter as lobar-type in 9 patients (81.8%) and in the basal ganglia in 2 patients (18.2%). Events occurred mostly within 1 week and up to 3 weeks after EVT. Hematoma was located on the ipsilateral side in 8 patients (72.7%) and in the contralateral side in 3 patients (27.3%). Compared with patients without remote ICH, there were more aneurysms located on the internal carotid artery (ICA) (P = 0.041), more patients treated with stents (P &lt; 0.001), more patients with hypertension (P = 0.026), and poorer clinical outcomes at discharge (P &lt; 0.001) for patients with remote ICH.ConclusionsThe incidence of remote ICH after EVT of UIAs was 0.46%.

Modeling perfusion in the cerebral vasculature,"AbstractThe constant perfusion of a human organ with nutrients and oxygen demands a robust regulatory mechanisms in the face of normal day-to-day pressure variations in the vasculature. The brain, in a similar manner to the heart requires this mechanism to be extremely quick acting, relative to other ways of altering perfusion such as varying systemic blood pressure, since oxygen depravation in the tissues of the brain can be tolerated for only of the order of tens of seconds before significant damage can be done.In recent years computational models, and it must be noted computer architecture have evolved to an extent where mathematicians and engineers can play a large part in discovering how the brain functions physiologically as well as investigating pathological conditions. This review will look at a number of increasingly complex computational models of blood flow to the brain and how variations in arterial geometry can influence the perfusion in the cerebral vasculature. Although these models have provided an insight into complex mechanisms the research area is densely populated with important questions that perhaps only computer models can answer. The review will indicate possible areas of investigation.",December 2008,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'T.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'David'}, {'given-name': 'S.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Moore'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1350453308001616,1-s2.0-S1350453308001616
Assessment and management of cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension in acute liver failure,"AbstractAcute liver failure is uncommon but not a rare complication of liver injury. It can happen after ingestion of acetaminophen and exposure to toxins and hepatitis viruses. The defining clinical symptoms are coagulopathy and encephalopathy occurring within days or weeks of the primary insult in patients without preexisting liver injury. Acute liver failure is often complicated by multiorgan failure and sepsis. The most life-threatening complications are sepsis, multiorgan failure, and brain edema. The clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) are nonspecific except for neurologic deficits in impending brain stem herniation. Computed tomography of the brain is not sensitive enough in gauging intracranial hypertension or ruling out brain edema. Intracranial pressure monitoring, transcranial Doppler, and jugular venous oximetry provide valuable information for monitoring ICP and guiding therapeutic measures in patients with encephalopathy grade III or IV. Osmotic therapy using hypertonic saline and mannitol, therapeutic hypothermia, and propofol sedation are shown to improve ICPs and stabilize the patient for liver transplantation. In this article, diagnosis and management of hepatic encephalopathy and cerebral edema in patients with acute liver failure are reviewed.",October 2013,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Vahid', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Mohsenin'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0883944113001093,1-s2.0-S0883944113001093
The influence of an unilateral carotid artery stenosis on brain oxygenation,"AbstractWe study the impact of varying degrees of unilateral stenoses of an carotid artery on pulsatile blood flow and oxygen transport from the heart to the brain. For the numerical simulation a model reduction approach is used involving non-linear 1-D transport equation systems, linear 1-D transport equations and 0-D models. The haemodynamic effects of vessels beyond the outflow boundaries of the 1-D models are accounted for using a 0-D lumped three element windkessel model. At the cerebral outflow boundaries the 0-D windkessel model is extended by metabolic autoregulation, based on the cerebral oxygen supply. Additionally lumped parameter models are applied to incorporate the impact of the carotid stenosis.

We examine whether this system can best be considered linear or non-linear.Methods: We assessed the adequacy of linear modeling in four ways: (1) Known properties of cerebral blood flow were reviewed and analyzed from a systems standpoint; (2) 1100 ARX &amp; OE model types were tested with data from 29 normal subjects, with and without lowpass filtering; (3) time–frequency analysis was used to identify nonstationary behavior and markers of non-linearity (such as bifurcations, chirps, and intermittent autoregulatory impairment) in the same data sets; (4) simple computer models of autoregulation incorporating time delays and non-linear elements were tested for production of spontaneous oscillations.Results: (1) Several aspects of cerebral hemodynamics are poorly described by linear models, (2) the ARX &amp; OE models performed poorly, (3) time–frequency analysis showed non-linear and nonstationary behavior, (4) the computer models produced spontaneous oscillations similar to those observed in humans.Conclusions: There is strong evidence that the blood pressure/velocity system is non-linear.",October 2003,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Cole A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Giller'}, {'given-name': 'Martin', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Mueller'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1350453303000286,1-s2.0-S1350453303000286
Effect of generalised sympathetic activation by cold pressor test on cerebral haemodynamics in healthy humans,"AbstractThere is no general agreement regarding several aspects of the role of the sympathetic system on cerebral haemodynamics such as extent of effectiveness, operational range and site of action. This study was planned to identify the effect of a generalised sympathetic activation on the cerebral haemodynamics in healthy humans before it is masked by secondary corrections, metabolic or myogenic in nature. A total of 35 healthy volunteers aged 20–35 underwent a 5 min lasting cold pressor test (CPT) performed on their left hand. The cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity in the middle cerebral arteries and arterial blood pressure were recorded with transcranial Doppler sonography and with a non-invasive finger-cuff method, respectively. The ratio of arterial blood pressure to mean blood velocity (ABP/Vm) and Pulsatility Index (PI) were calculated throughout each trial. CPT induced an increase in mean ABP (range 2–54 mmHg depending on the subject) and only a slight, though significant, increase in blood velocity in the middle cerebral artery (+2.4 and +4.4% on ipsi- and contralateral side, respectively). During CPT, the ratio ABP/Vm increased and PI decreased in all subjects on both sides. These changes began simultaneously with the increase in blood pressure. The increase in ABP/Vm ratio is attributed to an increase in the cerebrovascular resistance, while the concomitant reduction in PI is interpreted as due to the reduction in the compliance of the middle cerebral artery. The results suggest that generalised increases in the sympathetic discharge, causing increases in ABP, can prevent concomitant increases in CBF by acting on both small resistance and large compliant vessels. This effect is also present when a slight increase in blood pressure occurs, which suggests a moderate increase in the sympathetic discharge, i.e. when ABP remains far below the upper limit of CBF autoregulation.",15 July 1998,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Silvestro', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Roatta'}, {'given-name': 'Giuseppe', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Micieli'}, {'given-name': 'Daniele', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bosone'}, {'given-name': 'Gianni', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Losano'}, {'given-name': 'Roberto', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bini'}, {'given-name': 'Anna', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Cavallini'}, {'given-name': 'Magda', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Passatore'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165183898000757,1-s2.0-S0165183898000757
Modelling the circle of Willis to assess the effects of anatomical variations and occlusions on cerebral flows,"AbstractBlood flow in the circle of Willis (CoW) is modelled using the 1-D equations of pressure and flow wave propagation in compliant vessels. The model starts at the left ventricle and includes the largest arteries that supply the CoW. Based on published physiological data, it is able to capture the main features of pulse wave propagation along the aorta, at the brachiocephalic bifurcation and throughout the cerebral arteries. The collateral ability of the complete CoW and its most frequent anatomical variations is studied in normal conditions and after occlusion of a carotid or vertebral artery (VA). Our results suggest that the system does not require collateral pathways through the communicating arteries to adequately perfuse the brain of normal subjects. The communicating arteries become important in cases of missing or occluded vessels, the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) being a more critical collateral pathway than the posterior communicating arteries (PCoAs) if an internal carotid artery (ICA) is occluded. Occlusions of the VAs proved to be far less critical than occlusions of the ICAs. The worst scenario in terms of reduction in the mean cerebral outflows is a CoW without the first segment of an anterior cerebral artery combined with an occlusion of the contralateral ICA. Furthermore, in patients without any severe occlusion of a carotid or VA, the direction of flow measured at the communicating arteries corresponds to the side of the CoW with an absent or occluded artery. Finally, we study the effect of partial occlusions of the communicating arteries on the cerebral flows, which again confirms that the ACoA is a more important collateral pathway than the PCoAs if an ICA is occluded.",2007,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Alastruey'}, {'given-name': 'K.H.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Parker'}, {'given-name': 'J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Peiró'}, {'given-name': 'S.M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Byrd'}, {'given-name': 'S.J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sherwin'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021929006002946,1-s2.0-S0021929006002946
Persistence of isolated flow in the internal carotid artery in brain death,"AbstractThe criteria for the confirmation of brain death (BD) using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) state that flow should not be observed in the internal carotid artery (ICA). In 94 brain-dead patients examined by TCD, 19 (20%) had flow in the ICA despite cerebral circulatory arrest. There was no difference in the clinical characteristics of patients with or without isolated flow in the ICA. Shunting of blood from the ICA into the external carotid system or the arrest of blood flow at a higher level than the carotid siphon may explain our findings. Our results show that the current TCD criteria can result in a high rate of false negatives.

Assessing intracranial vascular compliance using dynamic arterial spin labeling,"AbstractVascular compliance (VC) is an important marker for a number of cardiovascular diseases and dementia, which is typically assessed in the central and peripheral arteries indirectly by quantifying pulse wave velocity (PWV), and/or pulse pressure waveform. To date, very few methods are available for the quantification of intracranial VC. In the present study, a novel MRI technique for in-vivo assessment of intracranial VC was introduced, where dynamic arterial spin labeling (ASL) scans were synchronized with the systolic and diastolic phases of the cardiac cycle. VC is defined as the ratio of change in arterial cerebral blood volume (ΔCBV) and change in arterial pressure (ΔBP). Intracranial VC was assessed in different vascular components using the proposed dynamic ASL method. Our results show that VC mainly occurs in large arteries, and gradually decreases in small arteries and arterioles. The comparison of intracranial VC between young and elderly subjects shows that aging is accompanied by a reduction of intracranial VC, in good agreement with the literature. Furthermore, a positive association between intracranial VC and cerebral perfusion measured using pseudo-continuous ASL with 3D GRASE MRI was observed independent of aging effects, suggesting loss of VC is associated with a decline in perfusion. Finally, a significant positive correlation between intracranial and central (aortic arch) VC was observed using an ungated phase-contrast 1D projection PWV technique. The proposed dynamic ASL method offers a promising approach for assessing intracranial VC in a range of cardiovascular diseases and dementia.",1 January 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Lirong', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Yan'}, {'given-name': 'Collin Y.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Liu'}, {'given-name': 'Robert X.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Smith'}, {'given-name': 'Mayank', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Jog'}, {'given-name': 'Michael', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Langham'}, {'given-name': 'Kate', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Krasileva'}, {'given-name': 'Yufen', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Chen'}, {'given-name': 'John M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ringman'}, {'given-name': 'Danny J.J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Wang'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053811915008058,1-s2.0-S1053811915008058
Compliance mismatch and compressive wall stresses drive anomalous remodelling of pulmonary trunks reinforced with Dacron grafts,"AbstractSynthetic grafts are often satisfactory employed in cardiac and vascular surgery, including expanded poly(ethylene terephthalate) or expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene). However, accumulating evidences suggest the emergence of worrisome issues concerning the long-term fate of prosthetic grafts as large vessel replacement. Disadvantages related to the use of synthetic grafts can be traced in their inability of mimicking the elasto-mechanical characteristics of the native vascular tissue, local suture overstress leading to several prosthesis-related complications and retrograde deleterious effects on valve competence, cardiac function and perfusion. Motivated by this, in the present work it is analyzed – by means of both elemental biomechanical paradigms and more accurate in silico Finite Element simulations – the physical interaction among aorta, autograft and widely adopted synthetic (Dacron) prostheses utilized in transposition of pulmonary artery, highlighting the crucial role played by somehow unexpected stress fields kindled in the vessel walls and around suture regions, which could be traced as prodromal to the triggering of anomalous remodelling processes and alterations of needed surgical outcomes. Theoretical results are finally compared with histological and surgical data related to a significant experimental animal campaign conducted by performing pulmonary artery transpositions in 30 two-month old growing lambs, followed up during growth for six months.

Arterial impulse model for the BOLD response to brief neural activation,"AbstractThe blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal evoked by brief neural stimulation, the hemodynamic response function (HRF), is a critical feature of neurovascular coupling. The HRF is directly related to local transient changes in oxygen supplied by cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen demand, the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2). Previous efforts to explain the HRF have relied upon the hypothesis that CBF produces a non-linear venous dilation within the cortical parenchyma. Instead, the observed dynamics correspond to prompt arterial dilation without venous volume change. This work develops an alternative biomechanical model for the BOLD response based on the hypothesis that prompt upstream dilation creates an arterial flow impulse amenable to linear description. This flow model is coupled to a continuum description of oxygen transport. Measurements using high-resolution fMRI demonstrate the efficacy of the model. The model predicts substantial spatial variations of the oxygen saturation along the length of capillaries and veins, and fits the varied gamut of measured HRFs by the combined effects of corresponding CBF and CMRO2 responses. Three interesting relationships among the hemodynamic parameters are predicted. First, there is an offset linear correlation with approximately unity slope between CBF and CMRO2 responses. Second, the HRF undershoot is strongly correlated to the corresponding CBF undershoot. Third, late-time-CMRO2 response can contribute to a slow recovery to baseline, lengthening the HRF undershoot. The model provides a powerful mathematical framework to understand the dynamics of neurovascular and neurometabolic responses that form the BOLD HRF.",1 January 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Jung Hwan', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kim'}, {'given-name': 'David', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ress'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053811915007892,1-s2.0-S1053811915007892
Investigation of the neurovascular coupling in positive and negative BOLD responses in human brain at 7T,"AbstractDecreases in stimulus-dependent blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal and their underlying neurovascular origins have recently gained considerable interest. In this study a multi-echo, BOLD-corrected vascular space occupancy (VASO) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique was used to investigate neurovascular responses during stimuli that elicit positive and negative BOLD responses in human brain at 7T. Stimulus-induced BOLD, cerebral blood volume (CBV), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes were measured and analyzed in ‘arterial’ and ‘venous’ blood compartments in macro- and microvasculature. We found that the overall interplay of mean CBV, CBF and BOLD responses is similar for tasks inducing positive and negative BOLD responses. Some aspects of the neurovascular coupling however, such as the temporal response, cortical depth dependence, and the weighting between ‘arterial’ and ‘venous’ contributions, are significantly different for the different task conditions. Namely, while for excitatory tasks the BOLD response peaks at the cortical surface, and the CBV change is similar in cortex and pial vasculature, inhibitory tasks are associated with a maximum negative BOLD response in deeper layers, with CBV showing strong constriction of surface arteries and a faster return to baseline. The different interplays of CBV, CBF and BOLD during excitatory and inhibitory responses suggests different underlying hemodynamic mechanisms.",15 August 2014,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Laurentius', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Huber'}, {'given-name': 'Jozien', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Goense'}, {'given-name': 'Aneurin J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kennerley'}, {'given-name': 'Dimo', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ivanov'}, {'given-name': 'Steffen N.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Krieger'}, {'given-name': 'Jöran', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Lepsien'}, {'given-name': 'Robert', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Trampel'}, {'given-name': 'Robert', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Turner'}, {'given-name': 'Harald E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Möller'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053811914002778,1-s2.0-S1053811914002778
Implementation of intrinsic lumped parameter modeling into computational fluid dynamics studies of cardiopulmonary bypass,"AbstractStroke and cerebral hypoxia are among the main complications during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The two main reasons for these complications are the cannula jet, due to altered flow conditions and the sandblast effect, and impaired cerebral autoregulation which often occurs in the elderly. The effect of autoregulation has so far mainly been modeled using lumped parameter modeling, while Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been applied to analyze flow conditions during CPB. In this study, we combine both modeling techniques to analyze the effect of lumped parameter modeling on blood flow during CPB. Additionally, cerebral autoregulation is implemented using the Baroreflex, which adapts the cerebrovascular resistance and compliance based on the cerebral perfusion pressure.The results show that while a combination of CFD and lumped parameter modeling without autoregulation delivers feasible results for physiological flow conditions, it overestimates the loss of cerebral blood flow during CPB. This is counteracted by the Baroreflex, which restores the cerebral blood flow to native levels. However, the cerebral blood flow during CPB is typically reduced by 10–20% in the clinic. This indicates that either the Baroreflex is not fully functional during CPB, or that the target value for the Baroreflex is not a full native cerebral blood flow, but the plateau phase of cerebral autoregulation, which starts at approximately 80% of native flow.",7 February 2014,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Tim A.S.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kaufmann'}, {'given-name': 'Michael', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Neidlin'}, {'given-name': 'Martin', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Büsen'}, {'given-name': 'Simon J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sonntag'}, {'given-name': 'Ulrich', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Steinseifer'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021929013005575,1-s2.0-S0021929013005575
Computer analysis of the main parameters extrapolated from the human intracranial basal artery blood flow,"AbstractIn the present work an original mathematical model of human intracranial dynamics is used to analyze the clinical significance of several parameters (systolic, diastolic, and mean blood flow, Gosling pulsatility index, and Pourcelot index) extrapolated from the intracranial basal artery blood flow waveform. In the model all the main phenomena characterizing intracranial dynamics (craniospinal pressure-volume relationship, arterial and venous intracranial compliances, cerebrospinal fluid production and absorption rates, cerebral autoregulation, terminal vein collapse) have been included according to anatomical and physiological data. From an analysis of the model simulation curves we can conclude that, if cerebral autoregulation is working well, only minor changes in blood flow patterns may be expected during moderate intracranial hypertension. However, when intracranial pressure is in the range of 40–60 mm Hg, the pulsatility and Pourcelot indexes exhibit a fairly linear dependence on ICP. However, this dependence may be less evident than expected because of changes in the ICP pulse amplitude. Finally, when the ICP exceeds about 70 mm Hg, the pulsatility index exhibits a disproportionate increase. This condition is associated with an evident increase in blood flow pulse amplitude. Moreover, with the present computer model not only the effect of intracranial pressure changes, but also that of several other biophysical factors (such as arterial compliance, craniospinal pressure-volume relationship, regulatory actions) on the intracranial artery blood flow shape can be analyzed and related to signals obtained using the Doppler transcranial technique.",December 1990,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Mauro', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ursino'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/001048099090040J,1-s2.0-001048099090040J
"Patient-specific mean pressure drop in the systemic arterial tree, a comparison between 1-D and 3-D models","AbstractOne-dimensional models of the systemic arterial tree are useful tools for studying wave propagation phenomena, however, their formulation for frictional losses is approximate and often based on solutions for developed flow in straight non-tapered arterial segments. Thus, losses due to bifurcations, tortuosity, non-planarity and complex geometry effects cannot be accounted for in 1-D models. This may lead to errors in the estimation of mean pressure. To evaluate these errors, we simulated steady flow in a patient specific model of the entire systemic circulation using a standard CFD code with Newtonian and non-Newtonian blood properties and compared the pressure evolution along three principal and representative arterial pathlines with the prediction of mean pressure, as given by the 1-D model. Pressure drop computed from aortic root up to iliac bifurcation and to distal brachial is less than 1mmHg and 1-D model predictions agree well with the 3-D model. In smaller vessels like the precerebral and cerebral arteries, the losses are higher (mean pressure drop over 10mmHg from mean aortic pressure) and are consistently underestimated by the 1-D model. Complex flow patterns resulting from tortuosity, non-planarity and branching yield shear stresses, which are higher than the ones predicted by the 1-D model. In consequence, the 1-D model overestimates mean pressure in peripheral arteries and especially in the cerebral circulation.",11 October 2012,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Philippe', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Reymond'}, {'given-name': 'Fabienne', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Perren'}, {'given-name': 'François', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Lazeyras'}, {'given-name': 'Nikos', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Stergiopulos'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021929012004174,1-s2.0-S0021929012004174
The influence of contrast agent injection on physiological flow in the circle of Willis,"AbstractX-ray videodensitometry allows in vivo flow measurements from gradients in contrast agent concentration. However, the injection of contrast agent alters the flow to be measured. Here, the temporal, spatial, and inter-patient variability of the response to injection are examined. To this purpose, an injection is prescribed in the internal carotid in a 1D wave propagation model of the arterial circulation. Although the resulting effect of injection is constant over a cardiac cycle, the response does vary with the location within the cerebral circulation and the geometry of the circle of Willis. At the injection site, the injection partly suppresses the incoming blood flow, such that the distal flow is increased by approximately 10%. This corresponds to approximately 20% of the injection rate added to the blood flow during injection, depending on the vascular geometry. In the communicating arteries, the flow direction is reversed during injection. Since the measured flow is not equal to the physiological blood flow, the effect of injection should be taken into account when deriving the flow from travelling contrast agent.",March 2011,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'G.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Mulder'}, {'given-name': 'A.C.B.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bogaerds'}, {'given-name': 'P.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Rongen'}, {'given-name': 'F.N.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'van de Vosse'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1350453310002171,1-s2.0-S1350453310002171
Transcranial Doppler ultrasound blood flow velocity and pulsatility index as systemic indicators for Alzheimer’s disease,"AbstractBackgroundMultiple lines of evidence suggest that cardiovascular co-morbidities hasten the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or accelerate its course.MethodsTo evaluate the utility of cerebral vascular physical function and/or condition parameters as potential systemic indicators of AD, transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound was used to assess cerebral blood flow and vascular resistance of the 16 arterial segments comprising the circle of Willis and its major tributaries.ResultsOur study showed that decreased arterial mean flow velocity and increased pulsatility index are associated with a clinical diagnosis of presumptive AD. Cerebral blood flow impairment shown by these parameters reflects the global hemodynamic and structural consequences of a multifaceted disease process yielding diffuse congestive microvascular pathology, increased arterial rigidity, and decreased arterial compliance, combined with putative age-associated cardiovascular output declines.ConclusionsTCD evaluation offers direct physical confirmation of brain perfusion impairment and might ultimately provide a convenient and a noninvasive means to assess the efficacy of medical interventions on cerebral blood flow or reveal incipient AD. In the near term, TCD-based direct assessments of brain perfusion might offer the prospect of preventing or mitigating AD simply by revealing patients who would benefit from interventions to improve circulatory system function.",July 2011,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Alex E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Roher'}, {'given-name': 'Zsolt', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Garami'}, {'given-name': 'Suzanne L.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Tyas'}, {'given-name': 'Chera L.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Maarouf'}, {'given-name': 'Tyler A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kokjohn'}, {'given-name': 'Marek', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Belohlavek'}, {'given-name': 'Linda J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Vedders'}, {'given-name': 'Donald', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Connor'}, {'given-name': 'Marwan N.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sabbagh'}, {'given-name': 'Thomas G.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Beach'}, {'given-name': 'Mark R.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Emmerling'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1552526010024556,1-s2.0-S1552526010024556
An impedance index in normal subjects and in subarachnoid hemorrhage,"AbstractThe impedance of a hemodynamic system is defined as the ratio of each harmonic component of blood pressure to that of flow. Calculation of impedance curves has been extensively performed in the systemic circulation, leading to the recognition of reflected pressure and flow waves and clarifying the shape of ultrasound waveforms. Impedance in the human cerebral circulation has not been measured primarily because of the relative inaccessibility of simultaneous flow and pressure data in the human cerebral circulation. We defined an impedance index using the transcranial Doppler waveform for that of flow and a noninvasive applanation measure of the carotid artery pressure waveform. Middle cerebral artery velocities and carotid artery pressure waveforms were simultaneously recorded in 16 vessels from 10 normal volunteers, 42 vessels in 14 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 14 vessels in 7 subjects during conditions of hypocapnia, normocapnia and hypercapnia. Impedance was calculated by dividing the harmonic associated with pressure divided by that of flow, and averaging 10 to 20 such calculations. Relative impedance curves were calculated by dividing by the impedance at the first harmonic. Impedance was also studied in an electrical model consisting of a Windkessel element containing inductance in series with a second Windkessel to model the large vessel and vascular bed, respectively. Model parameters were taken from the literature for these calculations. For the normal subjects, the shape of the impedance index curve was similar to those found in the systemic circulation. The impedance index curves for patients in vasospasm (middle cerebral velocity greater than 180) showed a peak at the second or third harmonic, which appeared more frequently than the nonspasm group (p &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, the ratio of the second harmonic to the first harmonic was significantly &gt;1.0 in the spasm group but significantly &lt;1.0 in the normal group (p &lt; 0.05). Calculations from the electrical model replicated the appearance of these peaks at the second or third harmonic for vasospasm parameters. A statistically significant peak appeared at the second or third harmonic in the impedance index curves for patients in vasospasm, which was replicated quantitatively by our electrical model. Although such peaks can be explained in the systemic circulation by the presence of reflected waves, the distance to the reflection site is larger than expected for the cerebral circulation. This suggests the importance of the inertia of blood as a stenosis worsens and as the origin for the observed changes in the impedance index curves.",1996,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'C.A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Giller'}, {'given-name': 'B.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ratcliff'}, {'given-name': 'B.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Berger'}, {'given-name': 'A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Giller'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0301562996000245,1-s2.0-0301562996000245
Model analogues in the study of cephalic circulation,"AbstractSimple laboratory models are useful to demonstrate cardiovascular principles involving the effects of gravity on the distribution of blood flow to the heads of animals, especially tall ones like the giraffe. They show that negative pressures cannot occur in collapsible vessels of the head, unless they are protected from collapse by external structures such as the cranium and cervical vertebrae. Negative pressures in the cerebral-spinal fluid (CSF) can prevent cerebral circulation from collapsing, and the spinal veins of the venous plexus can return blood to the heart in essentially rigid vessels. However, cephalic vessels outside the cranium are collapsible, so require positive blood pressures to establish flow; CSF pressure and venous plexus flow are irrelevant in this regard. Pressures in collapsible vessels reflect pressures exerted by surrounding tissues, which may explain the observed pressure gradient in the giraffe jugular vein. Tissue pressure is distinct from interstitial fluid pressure which has little influence on pressure gradients across the walls of major vessels.",April 2000,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Roger S', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Seymour'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S109564330000180X,1-s2.0-S109564330000180X

A multivariate regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between the Doppler pulsatility indices (PI) and the model-based parameters. The correlation between model-based parameters and the placental lesions was analyzed in a set of 13 IUGR placentas. A logistic regression analysis was done to assess the added value of the model-based parameters relative to Doppler indices, for the detection of fetuses with adverse perinatal outcome.ResultsThe estimated model-based placental and brain resistances were respectively increased and reduced in IUGR fetuses while placental compliance was increased in IUGR fetus. Umbilical and middle cerebral arteries PIs were most associated with both placental resistance and compliance, while uterine artery PI was more associated with the placental compliance. The logistic regression analysis showed that the model added significant information to the traditional analysis of Doppler waveforms for predicting adverse outcome in IUGR.DiscussionThe proposed patient-specific computational model seems to be a good approach to assess hemodynamic parameters than cannot be measured clinically.",September 2015,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Patricia', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Garcia-Canadilla'}, {'given-name': 'Fatima', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Crispi'}, {'given-name': 'Monica', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Cruz-Lemini'}, {'given-name': 'Stefania', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Triunfo'}, {'given-name': 'Alfons', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Nadal'}, {'given-name': 'Brenda', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Valenzuela-Alcaraz'}, {'given-name': 'Paula A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Rudenick'}, {'given-name': 'Eduard', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Gratacos'}, {'given-name': 'Bart H.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bijnens'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0143400415300242,1-s2.0-S0143400415300242
Multi-scale computational model of three-dimensional hemodynamics within a deformable full-body arterial network,"AbstractIn this article, we present a computational multi-scale model of fully three-dimensional and unsteady hemodynamics within the primary large arteries in the human. Computed tomography image data from two different patients were used to reconstruct a nearly complete network of the major arteries from head to foot. A linearized coupled-momentum method for fluid–structure-interaction was used to describe vessel wall deformability and a multi-domain method for outflow boundary condition specification was used to account for the distal circulation. We demonstrated that physiologically realistic results can be obtained from the model by comparing simulated quantities such as regional blood flow, pressure and flow waveforms, and pulse wave velocities to known values in the literature. We also simulated the impact of age-related arterial stiffening on wave propagation phenomena by progressively increasing the stiffness of the central arteries and found that the predicted effects on pressure amplification and pulse wave velocity are in agreement with findings in the clinical literature. This work demonstrates the feasibility of three-dimensional techniques for simulating hemodynamics in a full-body compliant arterial network.",1 July 2013,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Nan', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Xiao'}, {'given-name': 'Jay D.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Humphrey'}, {'given-name': 'C.

Leukoaraiosis and pulse-wave encephalopathy: Observations with phase-contrast MRI in mild cognitive impairment,"SummaryPurposeTo test the pathogenic hypothesis of a breakdown in the vital buffering of the arterial pulsations behind leukoaraiosis (LA) in mild cognitive impairment (MCI).MethodsSeventy-one elderly patients with MCI underwent a combined structural and dynamic MR examination (3D T1-weighted and fast-FLAIR T2-weighted sequences, phase contrast sequences). Arterial indices of pulsatility (IP) and composite indicators of the amplitude transfer function between cerebrospinal fluid and cerebral venous flow (Icsf/veins) were used to assess the large artery stiffness and the intracranial compliance respectively. Cerebral total arterial blood flow (tCBF), superficial and deep venous flow rates were also measured. Intracranial dynamic parameters and potential confounders including age, gender and vascular risk factors were compared between two groups respectively with and without significant LA.ResultsThe only dynamic changes on multivariate analyse were an IP increase, a lowering of deep venous outflow and Icsf/veins in patients with LA. There was a significant interaction between IP and Icsf/veins in the logistic regression: as compared with patients with low IP (suggestive of high large artery compliance) and high Icsf/veins (suggestive of high intracranial compliance), the adjusted odds ratios for the presence of LA were 9 (95% CI 1–64, P=0.02) in cases of both high IP and Icsf/veins, 10 (95% CI 1–64, P=0.02) in cases of both high IP and low Icsf/veins and 19 (95% CI 3–127, P=0.002) in cases of both low IP and Icsf/veins.ConclusionLA may reflect an arteriosclerotic and/or resistive pulse wave encephalopathy in MCI.",October 2009,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'M.-C.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Henry-Feugeas'}, {'given-name': 'C.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Roy'}, {'given-name': 'G.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Baron'}, {'given-name': 'E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Schouman-Claeys'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0150986109000121,1-s2.0-S0150986109000121
Beyond blood pressure: Arterial stiffness as a new biomarker of cardiovascular disease,"AbstractArterial stiffness of the large, elastic conduit arteries is considered a risk marker of vascular aging, as well as a new biomarker of cardiovascular (CV) disease. Arterial stiffness also plays an important role in the development of isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) in the middle-aged and elderly population. ISH is characterized by an increase in pulse pressure (PP) in association with a rise in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and a fall in diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Increased PP, however, is not always a good surrogate for arterial stiffening because of the frequent discrepancy between peripheral brachial and central aortic PP values due to varying pressure amplification. Therefore, noninvasive, easily performed methods for more direct measurement of arterial stiffness and wave reflection, such as aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and pulse wave analysis, have been developed for clinical use. The present review aims to provide an understanding of the pathophysiology of arterial stiffness and wave reflection, to review the various techniques for their measurement, and to explore their usefulness in predicting CV risk and therapeutic benefit in comparison with traditional brachial artery cuff blood pressure (BP) by sphygmomanometry.",May–June 2008,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Stanley S.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Franklin'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1933171107001945,1-s2.0-S1933171107001945
Computational modeling of blood flow steal phenomena caused by subclavian stenoses,"AbstractThe study of steal mechanisms caused by vessel obstructions is of the utmost importance to gain understanding about their pathophysiology, as well as to improve diagnosis and management procedures. The goal of this work is to perform a computational study to gain insight into the hemodynamic forces that drive blood flow steal mechanisms caused by subclavian artery stenosis. Such condition triggers a flow disorder known as subclavian steal. When this occurs in patients with internal thoracic artery anastomosed to the coronary vessels, the phenomenon includes a coronary-subclavian steal. True steal can exist in cases of increased arm blood flow, potentially resulting in neurological complications and, in the case of coronary-subclavian steal, graft function failure. In this context, the anatomically detailed arterial network (ADAN) model is employed to simulate subclavian steal and coronary-subclavian steal phenomena. Model results are verified by comparison with published data. It is concluded that this kind of model allows us to effectively address complex hemomdynamic phenomena occurring in clinical practice. More specifically, in the studied conditions it is observed that a regional brain steal occurs, primarily affecting the posterior circulation, not fully compensated by the anterior circulation. In the case of patients with coronary revascularization, it is concluded that there is a large variability in graft hemodynamic environments, which physically explain both the success of the procedure in cases of severe occlusive disease, and the reason for graft dysfunction in mildly stenosed left anterior descending coronary artery, due to alternating graft flow waveform signatures.",14 June 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'P.J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Blanco'}, {'given-name': 'L.O.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Müller'}, {'given-name': 'S.M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Watanabe'}, {'given-name': 'R.A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Feijóo'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021929016303888,1-s2.0-S0021929016303888
Analysis of Aortic Energetics from Pulse Wave Examination in a Porcine Study of Septic Shock,"AbstractAortic pressure (Pao) can be separated into two components representing the wave phenomena of flow, called excess pressure (Pex), and the storage capacity of the elastic arteries, called reservoir pressure (Pwk). Subject-specific aortic models, identified from measurements from a porcine study on septic shock, were used to calculate the hydraulic work associated with the excess and reservoir pressures (Wex, Wwk). Changes in these energies were compared to a metrics derived from left ventricular pressure-volume analysis. Total aortic work (Wao=Wex+Wwk) compared well to clinically assessed left ventricular work (R2=0.88). However, only a weak relationship of R2 = 0.24 was found between ventricular arterial coupling (Ees/Ea) and Wex/Wwk. Although a strong relationship (R2 = 0.76) was noticed between the inverse of afterload (1/Ea) and Wex. As septic shock progressed, a drop in Wwk was seen, indicating the arterial system loses its ability to store the stoke volume (SV) from the ventricle for release during diastole, resulting in a flattening of the diastolic pressure. These results indicate that one of the main reasons left ventricular afterload decreases during septic shock is because arterial system loses its ability to act as a storage reservoir.",2012,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'James A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Revie'}, {'given-name': 'David J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Stevenson'}, {'given-name': 'J.

Spatiotemporal characteristics and vascular sources of neural-specific and -nonspecific fMRI signals at submillimeter columnar resolution,"AbstractThe neural specificity of hemodynamic-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals is dependent on both the vascular regulation and the sensitivity of the applied fMRI technique to different types and sizes of blood vessels. In order to examine the specificity of MRI-detectable hemodynamic responses, submillimeter blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) fMRI studies were performed in a well-established cat orientation column model at 9.4T. Neural-nonspecific and -specific signals were separated by comparing the fMRI responses of orthogonal orientation stimuli. The BOLD response was dominantly neural-nonspecific, mostly originating from pial and intracortical emerging veins, and thus was highly correlated with baseline blood volume. Uneven baseline CBV may displace or distort small functional domains in high-resolution BOLD maps. The CBV response in the parenchyma exhibited dual spatiotemporal characteristics, a fast and early neural-nonspecific response (with 4.3-s time constant) and a slightly slower and delayed neural-specific response (with 9.4-s time constant). The nonspecific CBV signal originates from early-responding arteries and arterioles, while the specific CBV response, which is not correlated with baseline blood volume, arises from late-responding microvessels including small pre-capillary arterioles and capillaries. Our data indicate that although the neural specificity of CBV fMRI signals is dependent on stimulation duration, high-resolution functional maps can be obtained from steady-state CBV studies.",1 January 2013,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Chan Hong', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Moon'}, {'given-name': 'Mitsuhiro', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Fukuda'}, {'given-name': 'Seong-Gi', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kim'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053811912008737,1-s2.0-S1053811912008737

Uncertainty quantification of wall shear stress in intracranial aneurysms using a data-driven statistical model of systemic blood flow variability,"AbstractAdverse wall shear stress (WSS) patterns are known to play a key role in the localisation, formation, and progression of intracranial aneurysms (IAs). Complex region-specific and time-varying aneurysmal WSS patterns depend both on vascular morphology as well as on variable systemic flow conditions. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been proposed for characterising WSS patterns in IAs; however, CFD simulations often rely on deterministic boundary conditions that are not representative of the actual variations in blood flow. We develop a data-driven statistical model of internal carotid artery (ICA) flow, which is used to generate a virtual population of waveforms used as inlet boundary conditions in CFD simulations. This allows the statistics of the resulting aneurysmal WSS distributions to be computed. It is observed that ICA waveform variations have limited influence on the time-averaged WSS (TAWSS) on the IA surface. In contrast, in regions where the flow is locally highly multidirectional, WSS directionality and harmonic content are strongly affected by the ICA flow waveform. As a consequence, we argue that the effect of blood flow variability should be explicitly considered in CFD-based IA rupture assessment to prevent confounding the conclusions.",Available online 15 October 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Ali', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sarrami-Foroushani'}, {'given-name': 'Toni', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Lassila'}, {'given-name': 'Ali', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Gooya'}, {'given-name': 'Arjan J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Geers'}, {'given-name': 'Alejandro F.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Frangi'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021929016310843,1-s2.0-S0021929016310843

A two-level time step technique for the partitioned solution of one-dimensional arterial networks,"AbstractIn this work a numerical strategy to address the solution of the blood flow in one-dimensional arterial networks through a topology-based decomposition is presented. Such decomposition results in the local analysis of the blood flow in simple arterial segments. Hence, iterative methods are used to perform the strong coupling among the segments, which communicate through non-overlapping interfaces. Specifically, two approaches are considered to solve the associated nonlinear interface problem: (i) the Newton method and (ii) the Broyden method. Moreover, since the modeling of blood flow in compliant vessels is tackled using explicit finite element methods, we formulate the coupling problem using a two-level time stepping technique. A local (inner) time step is used to solve the local problems in single arteries, meeting thus local stability conditions, while a global (outer) time step is employed to enforce the continuity of physical quantities of interest among the one-dimensional segments. Several examples of application are presented. Firstly a study about spurious reflections produced at interfaces as a consequence of the two-level time stepping technique is carried out. Secondly, the application of the methodologies to physiological scenarios is presented, specifically addressing the solution of the blood flow in a model of the entire arterial network. The effects of non-uniformities of the material properties, of the variation of the radius, and of viscoelasticity are taken into account in the model and in the (local) numerical scheme; they are quantified and commented in the arterial network simulation.",1 September 2012,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'A.

The shape of the blood pressure curve and genetic hypertension,"AbstractPeak systolic pressure and end-diastolic pressure are two specific points of the blood pressure curve that are widely used and generally accepted to define hypertensive vascular disease. If the goal of research in hypertension, however, is to define high blood pressure as a mechanical signal related to cardiovascular risk through alterations of the arterial wall, then the totality of the blood pressure curve should be analyzed in detail. Fourier analysis indicates that the blood pressure curve may be divided into two components, a steady component, mean arterial pressure, and a pulsatile component, pulse pressure. For a given cardiac performance, the former is related to the caliber of small arteries and the latter to the mechanical properties of the large arteries. Whereas mean arterial pressure is practically unmodified along the arterial tree, pulse pressure increases markedly, owing to the progressive increase in pulse wave velocity and to the summation of forward and backward waves. This hemodynamic pattern is substantially modified with age, leading to various shapes and phenotypes of the blood pressure curve at any given value of mean arterial pressure. Such findings provide evidence that (a) the totality of the aortic blood pressure curve should be recorded in detail for genetic studies in experimental and human hypertension, and (b) the various phenotypic aspects of the blood pressure curve might influence the choice of the genetic markers that are used to study hypertensive vascular disease.",May–June 1995,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Michel E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Safar'}, {'given-name': 'Athanase', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Benetos'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/105017389500003R,1-s2.0-105017389500003R
Descending aorta subject-specific one-dimensional model validated against in vivo data,"AbstractThe aorta plays a major role in the cardiovascular system and its function and structure are primarily affected by aging, eating habits, life style and other cardiovascular risk factors, inducing increased stiffness which is associated with cardiovascular and cerebral morbi-mortality. Our objective was to develop and validate a robust subject-specific one-dimensional wave propagation numerical model of the descending aorta. This model with a cross-sectional area, velocity and pressure formulation is built using geometric and hemodynamic data measured on a specific person and is validated against in vivo data acquired on the same subject at three distinct anatomical locations along the thoracic aorta. We studied seven healthy volunteers, who underwent carotid applanation tonometry and aortic cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Responses of our model in terms of changes in central pressure waveform with arterial alterations were consistent with previously described physiological knowledge. Quantitative validation averaged over the three descending aortic locations and the seven subjects provided low rms errors (given in percentage of the maximal clinical value) between simulated and CMR data, i.e. area: 10±6%, velocity: 11±3%, flow rate: 9±3%. Finally, we also found low rms (5±2%) when comparing simulated pressure in the proximal aortic location against tonometric carotid pressure curves. In conclusion, this simple model performs similar to more complex models of the entire systemic arterial tree at a fraction of the cost, and could be of major usefulness in the non-invasive and local estimation of proximal biomechanical and hemodynamic indices.",22 January 2014,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bollache'}, {'given-name': 'N.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kachenoura'}, {'given-name': 'A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Redheuil'}, {'given-name': 'F.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Frouin'}, {'given-name': 'E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Mousseaux'}, {'given-name': 'P.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Recho'}, {'given-name': 'D.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Lucor'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021929013005617,1-s2.0-S0021929013005617
IRON fMRI measurements of CBV and implications for BOLD signal,"AbstractChanges in cerebral blood volume (CBV) and blood magnetization each induce changes in the transverse relaxation rate of MRI signal that are associated with changes in cerebral activity. BOLD signal, the preeminent method for non-invasive localization of task-induced brain function in human subjects, reflects a combination of changes in CBV and blood magnetization. Intravenous injection of paramagnetic contrast media, usually iron oxide particles surrounded by larger macromolecules, can overwhelm the BOLD response and sensitize signal to blood plasma volume, a method we have deemed “IRON” fMRI. The practical advantage of this technique is the ability to optimize blood magnetization at any echo time, enabling high detection power and the use of short echo times; for these reasons, IRON fMRI has become a valuable imaging tool in animal models. The temporal response of blood plasma volume is quite different from blood flow and BOLD signal; thus, CBV has been identified as a prominent source of transient features of the BOLD response. This article reviews the methodological advantages of the IRON method and how CBV measurements have informed our understanding of the BOLD response.",15 August 2012,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Joseph B.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Mandeville'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053811912000870,1-s2.0-S1053811912000870

Measuring hypertensive cardiovascular risk: The vascular overload concept,"AbstractHypertensive cardiovascular risk may be related primarily to vascular overload, the rum of three vascular abnormalities: increased arteriolar resistance, increased large-artery stiffness, and the effect of increased early pulse-wave reflection. A method for quantifying vascular overload as an index can be derived from measurements of mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that abnormal artery stiffness and early pulse-wave reflection become larger components of vascular overload as the duration and severity of hypertension increase. Moreover, these studies suggest that vascular overload is a true indicator of hypertensive cardiovascular risk. Increased systolic blood pressure is a surrogate for vascular overload in young and middle-aged hypertensive subjects. Increased pulse pressure and decreased diastolic pressure are superior to increased systolic pressure as surrogates for vascular overload in geriatric isolated systolic hypertension. By itself, diastolic blood pressure is difficult to interpret and may be an epiphenomenon. Therefore new therapeutic goals, are control of systolic pressure in the young and of pulse pressure in the elderly.",October 1994,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Stanley S', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Franklin'}, {'given-name': 'Michael A', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Weber'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/000287039490278X,1-s2.0-000287039490278X
Sequentially-Coupled Arterial Fluid–Structure Interaction (SCAFSI) technique,"AbstractThe Sequentially-Coupled Arterial Fluid–Structure Interaction (SCAFSI) technique is one of the special techniques developed recently by the Team for Advanced Flow Simulation and Modeling (T☆AFSM) for FSI modeling of blood flow and arterial dynamics. The SCAFSI technique, which was introduced as an approximate FSI approach in arterial fluid mechanics, is based on the assumption that the arterial deformation during a cardiac cycle is driven mostly by the blood pressure. In the SCAFSI, first we compute a “reference” arterial deformation as a function of time, driven only by the blood pressure profile of the cardiac cycle. Then we compute a sequence of updates involving mesh motion, fluid dynamics calculations, and recomputing the arterial deformation. Although the SCAFSI technique was developed and tested in conjunction with the stabilized space–time FSI (SSTFSI) technique, it can also be used in conjunction with other FSI modeling techniques categorized as moving-mesh methods. The SSTFSI technique is based on the Deforming-Spatial-Domain/Stabilized Space–Time (DSD/SST) formulation and includes the enhancements introduced recently by the T☆AFSM. The arterial structures can be modeled with the membrane or continuum elements, both of which are geometrically nonlinear, and the continuum element can be made of linearly-elastic or hyperelastic material (Mooney–Rivlin or Fung). Here we provide an overview of the SCAFSI technique and present a number of test computations for abdominal aortic and cerebral aneurysms, where the arterial geometries used in the computations are close approximations to the patient-specific image-based data.",15 September 2009,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Tayfun E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Tezduyar'}, {'given-name': 'Matthew', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Schwaab'}, {'given-name': 'Sunil', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sathe'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004578250800217X,1-s2.0-S004578250800217X
Evaluation of morphological changes of the atherosclerotic aorta by enhanced computed tomography,"AbstractEnhanced and non-enhanced computed tomography (CT) were performed in 405 subjects (222 men; 183 women; mean age 57 years). Intimal atherosclerotic changes of the aorta were quantified by enhanced CT, revealing the atheromatous intima to be projecting and thick-walled, while non-enhanced CT demonstrated aortic calcification. We measured the degree of aortic intimal changes at various segments of the aorta. In 224 cases, CT was performed from the aortic root to the bifurcation of the abdominal aorta. Intimal changes were found predominantly at the aortic arch, the middle descending thoracic and the infrarenal abdominal aorta. As for the intimal changes, aortic calcification and aortic pulse wave velocity were significant atherosclerotic characteristics. The aortic diameter did not show a significant association with intimal change. Among the various atherosclerotic risk factors, intimal change was significantly associated with age, systolic blood pressure, serum total cholesterol and diabetes mellitus, whereas gender, diastolic blood pressure, relative weight and cigarette use were not significantly related. For coronary artery disease and arteriosclerosis obliterans, aortic intimal changes constituted a significant atherosclerotic feature.

"Dynamic model for the tissue concentration and oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in relation to blood volume, flow velocity, and oxygen consumption: Implications for functional neuroimaging and coherent hemodynamics spectroscopy (CHS)","AbstractThis article presents a dynamic model that quantifies the temporal evolution of the concentration and oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in tissue, as determined by time-varying hemodynamic and metabolic parameters: blood volume, flow velocity, and oxygen consumption. This multi-compartment model determines separate contributions from arterioles, capillaries, and venules that comprise the tissue microvasculature, and treats them as a complete network, without making assumptions on the details of the architecture and morphology of the microvascular bed. A key parameter in the model is the effective blood transit time through the capillaries and its associated probability of oxygen release from hemoglobin to tissue, as described by a rate constant for oxygen diffusion. The solution of the model in the time domain predicts the signals measured by hemodynamic-based neuroimaging techniques such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in response to brain activation. In the frequency domain, the model yields an analytical solution based on a phasor representation that provides a framework for quantitative spectroscopy of coherent hemodynamic oscillations. I term this novel technique coherent hemodynamics spectroscopy (CHS), and this article describes how it can be used for the assessment of cerebral autoregulation and the study of hemodynamic oscillations resulting from a variety of periodic physiological challenges, brain activation protocols, or physical maneuvers.",15 January 2014,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Sergio', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Fantini'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053811913003157,1-s2.0-S1053811913003157
Computer modeling of cardiovascular fluid–structure interactions with the deforming-spatial-domain/stabilized space–time formulation,"AbstractHemodynamic factors such as the wall shear stress are believed to affect a number of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis and aneurysm. Since resolving phenomena in a living human body is currently beyond the capabilities of in vivo measurement techniques, computer modeling is expected to play an important role in gaining a better understanding of the relationship between the cardiovascular diseases and the hemodynamic factors. We have developed a computer modeling technique for cardiovascular hemodynamic simulations. With this modeling technique, patient-specific 3D geometry of an artery can be analyzed. We take into account some of the important factors in human body for the purpose of demonstrating in vivo situations in a virtual world. The interaction between the blood flow and the deformation of the arterial walls is a factor that we are specifically focusing on. For such fluid–structure interactions, we have developed a computer modeling tool based on the deforming-spatial-domain/stabilized space–time (DSD/SST) formulation. This simulation tool is applied to a patient-specific model under pulsatile blood flow conditions. The simulations show that the flow behavior with compliant arterial walls is different from what we see with rigid arterial walls. Consequently, the distribution of the wall shear stress on the compliant arterial walls is significantly different from that on the rigid arterial walls. We deduce that the compliance of the arterial walls needs to be taken into account in cardiovascular hemodynamic simulations, and the computer modeling tool we have developed can be effective in investigation of cardiovascular diseases.",15 February 2006,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Ryo', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Torii'}, {'given-name': 'Marie', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Oshima'}, {'given-name': 'Toshio', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kobayashi'}, {'given-name': 'Kiyoshi', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Takagi'}, {'given-name': 'Tayfun E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Tezduyar'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0045782505003117,1-s2.0-S0045782505003117
The Noninvasive Assessment of Vascular Aging,"AbstractThe growing interest in the clinical measurement of arterial aging through the noninvasive assessment of arterial stiffness is associated with important developments in novel methods and apparatus. In this review, we aimed to describe the major principles of the measurement of arterial stiffness and to critically review the advantages and limitations of the different methods. The measurement of regional stiffness is recommended by international guidelines for routine clinical practice. It is most often determined through pulse wave velocity (PWV) between 2 arterial sites. Methods using a single-site cuff-based measurement are promising. Local determination of arterial stiffness, obtained either with the well-established, high-resolution echo tracking systems or more recently with magnetic resonance imaging, is indicated for pathophysiological and pharmacologic studies. Novel apparatus that were developed for determining arterial stiffness claimed superiority over pioneering methods either through greater simplicity of use, better repeatability, or a more pertinent arterial pathway. However, the true additive value of measuring arterial aging with a given apparatus had to be translated into the predictive value of arterial stiffness as an intermediate end point, ie, the higher the arterial stiffness the higher the number of cardiovascular (CV) events. Thus, another important aim of this review was to analyze the amount of epidemiologic evidence obtained with a given method regarding the predictive value of arterial stiffness for CV events.",May 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Stéphane', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Laurent'}, {'given-name': 'Louise', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Marais'}, {'given-name': 'Pierre', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Boutouyrie'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0828282X16002129,1-s2.0-S0828282X16002129
Increased Wave Reflection Rather Than Central Arterial Stiffness Is the Main Determinant of Raised Pulse Pressure in Women and Relates to Mismatch in Arterial Dimensions A Twin Study,"ObjectivesOur aim was to examine the relative contributions of the first systolic shoulder (P1) and augmentation pressure (ΔPaug) to central pulse pressure (cPP), their relation to central arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity [PWV]) and arterial diameters, and their respective heritability estimates.BackgroundcPP is augmented above P1 by ΔPaugdue to pressure waves reflected from the periphery of the circulation.MethodsWomen (n = 496) from the Twins UK adult twin registry (112 monozygotic, 135 dizygotic pairs) age 21 to 81 years were studied. cPP, P1, and ΔPaugwere estimated using the SphygmoCor system (Atcor, West Ryde, Australia) from transformed radial waveforms. Carotid-femoral PWV was measured using the same system. Aortic and femoral artery diameters were measured by ultrasonography. Heritability was estimated using structural equation modeling.ResultsP1 and ΔPaugaccounted for 22% and 76%, respectively, of the variance in cPP. After adjustment for mean arterial pressure and heart rate, P1 strongly independently positively correlated with PWV (standardized regression coefficient, β = 0.4, p &lt; 0.0001), whereas ΔPaugdid not independently correlate with PWV but independently negatively correlated with the ratio of the diameter of the femoral to that of the abdominal aorta (β = −0.12, p &lt; 0.001). Estimates of heritability (h2) of cPP, PWV, P1, and ΔPaugwere 0.43, 0.34, 0.31, and 0.62, respectively, after adjustment for mean arterial pressure and heart rate.ConclusionsThese results suggest that, in women, ΔPaugis highly heritable, is associated with the ratio of distal to proximal arterial diameters, and, independent of PWV, is a major determinant of cPP.",18 August 2009,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Marina', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Cecelja'}, {'given-name': 'Benyu', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Jiang'}, {'given-name': 'Karen', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'McNeill'}, {'given-name': 'Bernet', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kato'}, {'given-name': 'James', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ritter'}, {'given-name': 'Tim', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Spector'}, {'given-name': 'Phil', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Chowienczyk'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S073510970901849X,1-s2.0-S073510970901849X
Physiologically informed dynamic causal modeling of fMRI data,"AbstractThe functional MRI (fMRI) signal is an indirect measure of neuronal activity. In order to deconvolve the neuronal activity from the experimental fMRI data, biophysical generative models have been proposed describing the link between neuronal activity and the cerebral blood flow (the neurovascular coupling), and further the hemodynamic response and the BOLD signal equation. These generative models have been employed both for single brain area deconvolution and to infer effective connectivity in networks of multiple brain areas. In the current paper, we introduce a new fMRI model inspired by experimental observations about the physiological underpinnings of the BOLD signal and compare it with the generative models currently used in dynamic causal modeling (DCM), a widely used framework to study effective connectivity in the brain. We consider three fundamental aspects of such generative models for fMRI: (i) an adaptive two-state neuronal model that accounts for a wide repertoire of neuronal responses during and after stimulation; (ii) feedforward neurovascular coupling that links neuronal activity to blood flow; and (iii) a balloon model that can account for vascular uncoupling between the blood flow and the blood volume. Finally, we adjust the parameterization of the BOLD signal equation for different magnetic field strengths. This paper focuses on the form, motivation and phenomenology of DCMs for fMRI and the characteristics of the various models are demonstrated using simulations. These simulations emphasize a more accurate modeling of the transient BOLD responses — such as adaptive decreases to sustained inputs during stimulation and the post-stimulus undershoot. In addition, we demonstrate using experimental data that it is necessary to take into account both neuronal and vascular transients to accurately model the signal dynamics of fMRI data. By refining the models of the transient responses, we provide a more informed perspective on the underlying neuronal process and offer new ways of inferring changes in local neuronal activity and effective connectivity from fMRI.",15 November 2015,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Martin', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Havlicek'}, {'given-name': 'Alard', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Roebroeck'}, {'given-name': 'Karl', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Friston'}, {'given-name': 'Anna', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Gardumi'}, {'given-name': 'Dimo', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ivanov'}, {'given-name': 'Kamil', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Uludag'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053811915006989,1-s2.0-S1053811915006989
"The BOLD post-stimulus undershoot, one of the most debated issues in fMRI","AbstractThis paper provides a brief overview of how we got involved in fMRI work and of our efforts to elucidate the mechanisms underlying BOLD signal changes. The phenomenon discussed here in particular is the post-stimulus undershoot (PSU), the interpretation of which has captivated many fMRI scientists and is still under debate to date. This controversy is caused both by the convoluted physiological origin of the BOLD effect, which allows many possible explanations, and the lack of comprehensive data in the early years. BOLD effects reflect changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF), volume (CBV), metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), and hematocrit fraction (Hct). However, the size of such effects is modulated by vascular origin such as intravascular, extravascular, macro and microvascular, venular and capillary, the relative contributions of which depend not only on the spatial resolution of the measurements, but also on stimulus duration, on magnetic field strength and on whether spin echo (SE) or gradient echo (GRE) detection is used. The two most dominant explanations of the PSU have been delayed vascular compliance (first venular, later arteriolar, and recently capillary) and sustained increases in CMRO2, while post-activation reduction in CBF is a distant third. MRI has the capability to independently measure CBF and arteriolar, venous, and total CBV contributions in humans and animals, which has been of great assistance in improving the understanding of BOLD phenomena. Using currently available MRI and optical data, we conclude that the predominant PSU origin is a sustained increase in CMRO2. However, some contributions from delayed vascular compliance are likely, and small CBF undershoot contributions that are difficult to detect with current arterial spin labeling technology can also not be excluded. The relative contribution of these different processes, which are not mutually exclusive and can act together, is likely to vary with stimulus duration and type.",15 August 2012,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Peter C.M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'van Zijl'}, {'given-name': 'Jun', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Hua'}, {'given-name': 'Hanzhang', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Lu'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053811912000468,1-s2.0-S1053811912000468
"Kinetic scheme for arterial and venous blood flow, and application to partial hepatectomy modeling","AbstractThe article introduces a kinetic scheme to solve the 1D Euler equations of hemodynamics, and presents comparisons of a closed-loop 1D–0D model with real measurements obtained after the hepatectomy of four pigs.Several benchmark tests show that the kinetic scheme compares well with more standard schemes used in the literature, for both arterial and venous wall laws. In particular, it is shown that it has a good behavior when the section area of a vessel is close to zero, which is an important property for collapsible or clamped vessels. The application to liver surgery shows that a model of the global circulation, including 0D and 1D equations, is able to reproduce the change of waveforms observed after different levels of hepatectomy. This may contribute to a better understanding of the change of liver architecture induced by hepatectomy.",Available online 22 July 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Chloe', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Audebert'}, {'given-name': 'Petru', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bucur'}, {'given-name': 'Mohamed', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bekheit'}, {'given-name': 'Eric', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Vibert'}, {'given-name': 'Irene E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Vignon-Clementel'}, {'given-name': 'Jean-Frédéric', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Gerbeau'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0045782516307356,1-s2.0-S0045782516307356
Systolic Blood Pressure Revisited,"AbstractThe clinical importance of systolic blood pressure (SBP) needs no emphasis. Its determinants are well known, but recent studies of one of these determinants, arterial distensibility, have led to results that now have clinical relevance. This review summarizes the role of arterial stiffness in ventricular-vascular coupling in the normal circulation and that disordered by aging and hypertension. The discussion defines the unfamiliar terms of compliance, distensibility and modulus and indicates how they are measured. Such measurements have increased our understanding of the parts played by the inhomogeneity of the arterial tree and reflected pressure waves in governing SBP. Elevated SBP is a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular complications among older patients, but when this elevation is due to a stiffened arterial tree, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is necessarily reduced. Early epidemiologic studies in hypertension required a DBP ≥90 mm Hg for hospital admission. They therefore excluded persons with high SBP, low DBP and very wide pulse pressure (PP). More recent inclusion of such patients has shown that elevation of SBP and PP is a strong predictor of cardiovascular risk. These considerations point to a possible redefinition of hypertension to include patients with lower DBP and to the inaccuracy but indispensability of the brachial artery pressure as a surrogate for aortic pressure—the pressure the heart sees. Finally, we review the known effects of available antihypertensive drugs on the arterial wall and indicate possible future directions of research stemming from wider understanding of the role of arterial distensibility in hypertension.(J Am Coll Cardiol 1997;29:1407–13)",June 1997,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Harold', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Smulyan'}, {'given-name': 'Michel E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Safar'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735109797000818,1-s2.0-S0735109797000818

Numerical simulation of left ventricular assist device implantations: Comparing the ascending and the descending aorta cannulations,"AbstractIn this work we present numerical simulations of continuous flow left ventricle assist device implantation with the aim of comparing difference in flow rates and pressure patterns depending on the location of the anastomosis and the rotational speed of the device. Despite the fact that the descending aorta anastomosis approach is less invasive, since it does not require a sternotomy and a cardiopulmonary bypass, its benefits are still controversial. Moreover, the device rotational speed should be correctly chosen to avoid anomalous flow rates and pressure distribution in specific location of the cardiovascular tree. With the aim of assessing the differences between these two approaches and device rotational speed in terms of flow rate and pressure waveforms, we set up numerical simulations of network of one-dimensional models where we account for the presence of an outflow cannula anastomosed to different locations of the aorta. Then, we use the resulting network to compare the results of the two different cannulations for several stages of heart failure and different rotational speed of the device. The inflow boundary data for the heart and the cannulas are obtained from a lumped parameters model of the entire circulatory system with an assist device, which is validated with clinical data. The results show that ascending and descending aorta cannulations lead to similar waveforms and mean flow rate in all the considered cases. Moreover, regardless of the anastomosis region, the rotational speed of the device has an important impact on wave profiles; this effect is more pronounced at high RPM.",October 2013,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Jean', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bonnemain'}, {'given-name': 'A.

Vascular mechanics in the clinic,"AbstractThe bioengineer has more to contribute to medicine than he/she ever has in the past. The successful contribution must be based on such experiences as described by Donald McDonald in his collaboration with John Womersley.

They must be prepared to compromise, but to know where compromise is warranted, and where it is not.The clinician must be prepared to change if he/she is to gain help from the engineer. Blind acceptance of old concepts (of “hypertension”, and of cuff sphygmomanometric accuracy, etc.) needs enlightenment, while acceptance of physiological reality such as wave reflection needs emerge. The clinician's vocabulary will need to change.This chapter opens with a discussion of a time where knowledge of engineering, physics, physiology and medicine was meagre. These disciplines were small, but they did interconnect through the work of renaissance (and later) scientists. With increase in knowledge, the disciplines enlarged, and grew apart from each other.

The Role of Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy in the Treatment of Communicating Hydrocephalus,"ObjectiveTo elucidate the role of endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) in patients with secondary and idiopathic communicating hydrocephalus (HCP).MethodsA series of 36 patients with communicating HCP (21 men and 15 women) were treated by ETV between November 2007 and February 2010. The patients age ranged from 19 to 81 years old (mean 52 years), and had a follow-up of 6 to 36 months (mean 9.2 months). The patients were divided into a group of 29 patients with secondary communicating HCP and a group of 7 patients with normal pressure HCP. Sixteen (44.4%) of the patients had a previous ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement that presented with shunt malfunction.ResultsThe etiology of secondary HCP was subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningitis, trauma, neoplasm, and others. Etiology was not possible to determine in some patients. The outcome of ETV was considered successful in 27/36 patients (75%). A Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the successful proportion of ETVs in secondary communicating HCP at 0.5, 1, and 3 months of follow-up was 0.83, 0.8, and 0.77, respectively; in the idiopathic normal pressure HCP group it was 0.83 initially and became stable at 0.66 after the first month. Overall, the successful proportion of ETV in communicating HCP was at 0, 0.5, 1, and 3 months of follow-up was 0.97, 0.83, 0.78, and 0.75.ConclusionsETV is a good option in the management of secondary communicating HCP, normal pressure HCP, and replacing malfunctioning ventriculoperitoneal shunts.

High-resolution Roeʼs scheme and characteristic boundary conditions for solving complex wave reflection phenomena in a tree-like arterial structure,"AbstractOur understanding of information carried by waves propagating in cardiovascular systems has rapidly advanced in recent years due to usage of modeling and simulations. The present research aims at developing a high-resolution numerical scheme that can be applied to solve mutually interactive one-dimensional (1-D) flows that prevail in tree-like arterial networks. A scheme using finite-volume, Roe-splitting flux-difference method in conjunction with a time-accurate Runge–Kutta marching method was developed. The theory of characteristics was adopted for the treatment of boundary conditions, resulting in a unified formulism using a newly defined reflection coefficient as a measure to quantify the wave reflection occurring at the interior and terminal nodes of the tree-like vascular structure. The derived boundary condition formulas are convenient for dealing with various types of boundary specification requirements that may arise in vascular hemodynamics. There are two computational models, an isolated tubular conduit and a tree-like structure model, that were employed for the present scheme validation and wave simulation demonstration. The objective was to assess the accuracy of the present scheme in capturing long-duration, complex, and tiny wave reflections and re-reflections. The superiority of the present scheme on capturing discontinuous jumps was first demonstrated in the isolated conduit simulation by comparing the results against exact solutions as well as those obtained by Lax–Wendroff method. To evaluate and validate the time-accuracy of the present scheme in treating multiple wave reflections and re-reflections in tree-like structures, a linear wave-tracking algorithm was employed. Compared to the Lax–Wendroff finite-difference method, the present flux-difference Roe-splitting scheme was shown to be more robust and accurate, which offers high-resolution with minimal dissipation and dispersion errors in simulating long-duration, mutually interacting wave reflections and re-reflections that commonly occur in the tree-like arterial network.",1 March 2014,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Bo-Wen', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Lin'}, {'given-name': 'Pong-Jeu', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Lu'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021999113008413,1-s2.0-S0021999113008413

There was an effect of cohort on PFWM (t = 5.08, degree of freedom [df] = 424, p &lt; 5.7 × 10−7), after accounting for nuisance effects from head displacement and global signal (t &gt; 6.16). From the neuroimaging data, PFWM was associated with glucose metabolism (t = –2.93, df = 96, p = 0.004) but not ventricular volume (p &lt; 0.49) or hippocampal volume (p &gt; 0.44). From the cognitive data, PFWM was associated with composite memory (t = –3.24, df = 149, p = 0.0015) but not executive function (p &gt; 0.21). PFWM was not associated with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. In one final omnibus model to explain PFWM (n = 124), glucose metabolism (p = 0.04) and cohort (p = 0.008) remained significant, as were global and head motion root-mean-square terms, whereas memory was not (p = 0.64). PFWM likely reflects end-arteriole intracranial pulsatility effects that may provide additional diagnostic potential in the context of AD neurodegeneration.",January 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Ilia', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Makedonov'}, {'given-name': 'J.

Physiology of the fetal circulation,"SummaryOur understanding of fetal circulatory physiology is based on experimental animal data, and this continues to be an important source of new insight into developmental mechanisms. A growing number of human studies have investigated the human physiology, with results that are similar but not identical to those from animal studies. It is time to appreciate these differences and base more of our clinical approach on human physiology. Accordingly, the present review focuses on distributional patterns and adaptational mechanisms that were mainly discovered by human studies. These include cardiac output, pulmonary and placental circulation, fetal brain and liver, venous return to the heart, and the fetal shunts (ductus venosus, foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus). Placental compromise induces a set of adaptational and compensational mechanisms reflecting the plasticity of the developing circulation, with both short- and long-term implications. Some of these aspects have become part of the clinical physiology of today with consequences for surveillance and treatment.",December 2005,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Torvid', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kiserud'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1744165X05000685,1-s2.0-S1744165X05000685

Relative Blood Flow Changes Measured Using Calibrated Frequency-Weighted Doppler Power at Different Hematocrit Levels,"AbstractIn theory, the power of a trans-cranial Doppler signal may be used to measure changes in blood flow and vessel diameter in addition to velocity. In this study, a flow index (FI) of relative changes in blood flow was derived from frequency-weighted Doppler power signals. The FI, plotted against velocity, was calibrated to the zero intercept with absent flow to reduce the effects of non-uniform vessel insonation. An area index was also calculated. FIs were compared with actual flow in four silicone tubes of different diameter at increasing flow rates and increasing hematocrit (Hct) in a closed-loop phantom model. FI values were strongly correlated with actual flow, at constant Hct, but varied substantially with changes in Hct. Percentage changes in area indexes, relative to the 4-mm tube, were strongly correlated with tube cross-sectional area. The implications of these results for in vivo use are discussed.",April 2014,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Sean', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Wallace'}, {'given-name': 'Nicola', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Logallo'}, {'given-name': 'Kashif W.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Faiz'}, {'given-name': 'Christian', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Lund'}, {'given-name': 'Rainer', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Brucher'}, {'given-name': 'David', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Russell'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301562913007229,1-s2.0-S0301562913007229
Monitoring intracranial dynamics by transcranial Doppler—a new Doppler index: Trans systolic time,"AbstractSince the introduction of transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) several investigators have described the relationship between raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and Doppler waveform. This waveform has been expressed by several indices, such as the pulsatility index (PI) and the resistance index (RI). These indices are used to demonstrate the presence of raised ICP. In childhood hydrocephalus this information can be used to indicate the need for shunt implantation. However, PI and RI do prove to have certain disadvantages as both are strongly influenced by the heart rate. Moreover, both indices have a broad range of reference values, especially in children. Therefore, they are not very reliable for detecting insidious changes in the ICP. These drawbacks are due to the fact that these indices are composed of blood flow velocity measurements and do not embody the slope of the TCD waveform itself. An ideal TCD waveform analysis should be performed concerning the time-related changes of the velocities. We present a hydrodynamic model, with its electrical analogue, which shows the effects of raised ICP on the intracranial hemodynamic system. Based on these physical findings we define a new Doppler index, the Trans Systolic Time, reflecting specific changes in the TCD waveform induced by changes in the mean ICP. The applicability of this index, compared with PI and RI, is illustrated by consecutive simultaneous TCD and AFP measurements in three children with hydrocephalus.",1995,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'P.W.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Hanlo'}, {'given-name': 'R.J.A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Peters'}, {'given-name': 'R.H.J.M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Gooskens'}, {'given-name': 'R.M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Heethaar'}, {'given-name': 'R.W.M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Keunen'}, {'given-name': 'A.C.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'van Huffelen'}, {'given-name': 'C.A.F.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Tulleken'}, {'given-name': 'J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Willemse'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0301562994001476,1-s2.0-0301562994001476
Early Outcomes Using the Florida Sleeve Repair for Correction of Aortic Insufficiency due to Root Aneurysms,"BackgroundThe Florida sleeve procedure is a simplified valve-sparing technique for repair of functional type I aortic insufficiency associated with root aneurysms. Midterm outcomes are reported, including standard echocardiographic measurements.MethodsThe study included all patients undergoing the Florida sleeve procedure who had at least 2 years of postoperative echocardiographic follow-up. Data were acquired preoperatively and postoperatively at 1 week and 1, 2, and 3 years. Measurements analyzed included left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD), and degree of aortic insufficiency.ResultsComplete echocardiographic data for a mean 32 ± 6.3 months after repair were available for 18 patients. Mean LVEDD decreased from 51.6 ± 7.4 to 49.7 ± 6.3 mm at 1 week (p = 0.05) and 47.1 ± 6.3 mm at 1 year (p = 0.008), and remained unchanged at 47.2 ± 6.6 and 47.1 ± 5.0 mm at 2 and 3 years. Mean LVESD decreased from 35.2 ± 7.6 to 32.9 ± 7.0 mm at 1 week (p = 0.002) and 30.7 ± 5.6 mm at 1 year (p ω 0.001), and remained unchanged at 30.9 ± 6.2 and 31.7 ± 4.9 mm after 2 and 3 years. The mean grade of aortic insufficiency decreased from 2.61 ± 0.78 to 1.39 ± 0.85 mm at 1 week (p ω 0.001) and remained 1.39 ± 0.84 mm at 1 year. Aortic insufficiency increased to 1.72 ± 0.89 (p = 0.03) at 2 years and decreased to 1.67 ± 0.50 (p = 0.59, from 1 week postoperatively) at 3 years.ConclusionsThe sustained reduction of left ventricular dimensions 3 years after operation suggests the Florida sleeve procedure is a durable valve repair. A minor increase in the degree of aortic insufficiency warrants close follow-up, but the absence of an increase of LVEDD supports continued use of the procedure in closely studied series.",April 2009,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Philip J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Hess'}, {'given-name': 'P.

Recent Advances in the Application of Computational Mechanics to the Diagnosis and Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease,"During the last 30 years, research into the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease has had to employ a multidisciplinary approach involving a wide range of subject areas, from molecular and cell biology to computational mechanics and experimental solid and fluid mechanics. In general, research was driven by the need to provide answers to questions of critical importance for disease management. Ongoing improvements in the spatial resolution of medical imaging equipment coupled to an exponential growth in the capacity, flexibility, and speed of computational techniques have provided a valuable opportunity for numerical simulations and complex experimental techniques to make a contribution to improving the diagnosis and clinical management of many forms of cardiovascular disease. This paper contains a review of recent progress in the numerical simulation of cardiovascular mechanics, focusing on three particular areas: patient-specific modeling and the optimization of surgery in pediatric cardiology, evaluating the risk of rupture in aortic aneurysms, and noninvasive characterization of intraventricular flow in the management of heart failure.",June 2009,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Juan C.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'del Álamo'}, {'given-name': 'Alison L.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Marsden'}, {'given-name': 'Juan C.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Lasherasa'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S188558570972359X,1-s2.0-S188558570972359X

A hemodynamic model for layered BOLD signals,"AbstractHigh-resolution blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at the sub-millimeter scale has become feasible with recent advances in MR technology. In principle, this would enable the study of layered cortical circuits, one of the fundaments of cortical computation. However, the spatial layout of cortical blood supply may become an important confound at such high resolution. In particular, venous blood draining back to the cortical surface perpendicularly to the layered structure is expected to influence the measured responses in different layers. Here, we present an extension of a hemodynamic model commonly used for analyzing fMRI data (in dynamic causal models or biophysical network models) that accounts for such blood draining effects by coupling local hemodynamics across layers. We illustrate the properties of the model and its inversion by a series of simulations and show that it successfully captures layered fMRI data obtained during a simple visual experiment. We conclude that for future studies of the dynamics of layered neuronal circuits with high-resolution fMRI, it will be pivotal to include effects of blood draining, particularly when trying to infer on the layer-specific connections in cortex — a theme of key relevance for brain disorders like schizophrenia and for theories of brain function such as predictive coding.",15 January 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Jakob', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Heinzle'}, {'given-name': 'Peter J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Koopmans'}, {'given-name': 'Hanneke E.M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'den Ouden'}, {'given-name': 'Sudhir', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Raman'}, {'given-name': 'Klaas Enno', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Stephan'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053811915009350,1-s2.0-S1053811915009350
Effects of lesions on synchrony and metastability in cortical networks,"AbstractAt the macroscopic scale, the human brain can be described as a complex network of white matter tracts integrating grey matter assemblies — the human connectome. The structure of the connectome, which is often described using graph theoretic approaches, can be used to model macroscopic brain function at low computational cost. Here, we use the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators with time-delays, calibrated with respect to empirical functional MRI data, to study the relation between the structure of the connectome and two aspects of functional brain dynamics — synchrony, a measure of general coherence, and metastability, a measure of dynamical flexibility. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between the local structure of the connectome, quantified using graph theory, and the synchrony and metastability of the model's dynamics. By removing individual nodes and all of their connections from the model, we study the effect of lesions on both global and local dynamics. Of the nine nodal graph-theoretical properties tested, two were able to predict effects of node lesion on the global dynamics. The removal of nodes with high eigenvector centrality leads to decreases in global synchrony and increases in global metastability, as does the removal of hub nodes joining topologically segregated network modules. At the level of local dynamics in the neighbourhood of the lesioned node, structural properties of the lesioned nodes hold more predictive power, as five nodal graph theoretical measures are related to changes in local dynamics following node lesions. We discuss these results in the context of empirical studies of stroke and functional brain dynamics.",September 2015,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'František', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Váša'}, {'given-name': 'Murray', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Shanahan'}, {'given-name': 'Peter J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Hellyer'}, {'given-name': 'Gregory', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Scott'}, {'given-name': 'Joana', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Cabral'}, {'given-name': 'Robert', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Leech'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053811915004243,1-s2.0-S1053811915004243
