Bidirectional functions of thrombin on fibrinolysis: Evidence of thrombin-dependent enhancement of fibrinolysis provided by spontaneous plasma clot lysis,"AbstractBesides procoagulant activity, thrombin exhibits anticoagulant and profibrinolytic activities. We demonstrated that the euglobulin clot lysis time (ECLT) was shortened by endogenously generated thrombin as a result of the inactivation of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). In contrast, thrombin suppressed fibrinolytic activity through the activation of thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI). Here, using three different clot lysis assays of the ECLT, the tissue plasminogen activator supplemented plasma clot lysis time (tPA-PCLT) and the spontaneous plasma clot lysis time (s-PCLT), we analyzed how the coagulation process modifies fibrinolysis. The ECLT was shortened by exogenously supplemented thrombin in a dose-dependent manner in the absence of calcium ion (Ca++), whereas this shortening was not observed in the presence of Ca++ where endogenous prothrombin was effectively activated to thrombin. This shortening was also not observed for the tPA-PCLT, in which tPA is supplemented in excess and PAI-1 activity is mostly lost. On the contrary, thrombin dose-dependently prolonged the tPA-PCLT, which was mostly abolished by inhibitors of carboxypeptidase and activated FXIII, suggesting that the prolongation is TAFI- and Factor XIII-dependent. The s-PCLT was shortened when thrombin generation was boosted by supplementing tissue factor and phosphatidylserine together with Ca++, which was more apparent in the presence of inhibitors of activated FXIII and activated TAFI. Thus, thrombin appeared to express its enhancing effect on fibrinolysis even in plasma, in addition to its inhibiting effect. These bidirectional functions of thrombin on fibrinolysis seem to take place on demand under different environments to maintain adequate vascular blood flow.",July 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Martyna', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Tomczyk'}, {'given-name': 'Yuko', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Suzuki'}, {'given-name': 'Hideto', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sano'}, {'given-name': 'Tomasz', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Brzoska'}, {'given-name': 'Hiroki', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Tanaka'}, {'given-name': 'Tetsumei', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Urano'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384816303164,1-s2.0-S0049384816303164
The association of clot lysis time with total obesity is partly independent from the association of PAI-1 with central obesity in African adults,"AbstractIntroductionPreliminary evidence indicates that the association of fibrinolytic potential, measured as clot lysis time (CLT), with body composition may differ from that of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1). We therefore investigated the association between fibrinolytic markers (plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 activity (PAI-1act) and CLT) and body composition using detailed body composition analyses.Materials and methodsData from 1288 Africans were cross-sectionally analyzed. Body composition analysis included BMI, waist circumference (WC); waist to height ratio (WHtR), skinfolds and body fat percentage measured with air-displacement plethysmography and bioelectrical impedance analysis.ResultsPAI-1act and CLT were significantly higher in women than in men, despite adjustment for differences in body composition. PAI-1act and CLT showed similar linear positive relationships with body composition (BMI, WC, WHtR, skinfolds) in men. In women CLT also showed a linear relationship with body composition, while PAI-1act levels plateaued at higher BMI and did not differ across skinfold categories. PAI-1act showed stronger correlations with body composition markers in men than it did in women, while no sex differences existed for CLT. PAI-1act associated more strongly with central obesity, while CLT associated with total body fat.ConclusionsObserved differences may be related to differences in adipose tissue type, distribution and sequence of accumulation between sexes. PAI-1act is strongly influenced by accumulation of visceral adipose tissue, whereas CLT is associated with obesity independent of type and sequence of body fat accumulation in this African adult study population.",August 2015,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Philna', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Eksteen'}, {'given-name': 'Marlien', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Pieters'}, {'given-name': 'Zelda', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'de Lange'}, {'given-name': 'Herculina S.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kruger'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384815300086,1-s2.0-S0049384815300086
Purification and characterization of a novel C-type hemolytic lectin for clot lysis from the fresh water clam Villorita cyprinoides: A possible natural thrombolytic agent against myocardial infarction,"AbstractVillorita cyprinoides (black clam) is a fresh water clam that belongs as a bivalve to the group of mollusc. The saline extracts from the muscle reveal high titers of agglutination potency on trypsin-treated rabbit erythrocytes. With the help of affinity chromatography a hemolytic protein with lectin activity which could all be inhibited by d-galactose were isolated. The lectins were separated on DEAE-cellulose and the main component was purified after an additional step of gel filtration on sephadex G-75. The main component is a non-glycosylated protein with a molecular weight of 96,560 Da determined by MALDI-ToF, consisting of a single protein chain and characterized by the lack of polymers and intermediate disulfide bonds. The pure main lectin with clot lytic feature shows two bands at molecular weights 36,360 and 26, 520 Da. Optimal inhibition of the pure lectin is achieved by d-galactose containing oligo- and polysaccharides. The lectin activity decreased above 40 °C and was lost at 62 °C, the stability over the pH range between 7.0 and 8.0 and requires divalent cations for their activity. The novel C-type hemolytic lectin for clot lysis from the clam Villorita cyprinoides was identified and evaluated, the purified hemolytic lectin (0.35 mg/ml and 0.175 mg/ml) enhanced clot lysis activity when compared to the different concentration (5 mg/ml and 1 mg/ml) of commercial streptokinase. In the present study identified hemolytic lectin was a rapid and effective clot lytic molecule and could be developed as new drug molecule in future.",February 2014,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'G.R.

Sonothrombolysis: The Contribution of Stable and Inertial Cavitation to Clot Lysis,"AbstractMicrobubble-mediated sonothrombolysis (STL) is a remarkable approach to vascular occlusion therapy. However, STL remains a complex process with multiple interactions between clot, ultrasound (US), microbubbles (MB) and thrombolytic drug. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of combining US and MB to degrade fibrin and, more specifically, to assess the roles of both stable (SC) and inertial (IC) cavitation. Human blood clots containing radiolabeled fibrin were exposed to different combinations of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), US (1 MHz) and phospholipid MB. Three acoustic pressures were tested: 200, 350 and 1,300 kPa (peak-negative pressure). Clot lysis was assessed by diameter loss and release of radioactive fibrin degradation products. The combination rtPA + US + MB clearly revealed that IC (1,300 kPa) was able to enhance fibrin degradation significantly (66.3 ± 1.8%) compared with rtPA alone (51.7 ± 2.0%, p &lt; 0.001). However, SC failed to enhance fibrin degradation at an acoustic pressure of 200 kPa. At 350 kPa, a synergistic effect between rtPA and US + MB was observed with an absolute increase of 6% compared to rtPA alone (p &lt; 0.001). Conversely, without rtPA, the combination of US + MB was unable to degrade the fibrin network (0.3 ± 0.1%, p &gt; 0.05 vs. control), but induced a distinct loss of red blood cells throughout the entire thickness of the clot, implying that MB were able to penetrate and cavitate inside the clot.",May 2015,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'B.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Petit'}, {'given-name': 'Y.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bohren'}, {'given-name': 'E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Gaud'}, {'given-name': 'P.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bussat'}, {'given-name': 'M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Arditi'}, {'given-name': 'F.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Yan'}, {'given-name': 'F.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Tranquart'}, {'given-name': 'E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Allémann'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301562914008011,1-s2.0-S0301562914008011
"Interconnectedness of global hemostasis assay parameters in simultaneously evaluated thrombin generation, fibrin generation and clot lysis in normal plasma","AbstractBackgroundFluorogenic thrombin generation (TG) assays and turbidity-based fibrin generation (FG)- and fibrinolysis (FL)-resistance assays have been sought to assess bleeding and clotting disorders. Theoretically, TG, FG and FL tests should provide overlapping information because thrombin is responsible for FG and induces protection from FL. The relationships between TG, FG and FL parameters remain poorly investigated, partly because existing experimental systems do not permit simultaneous detection of both TG and FG in the same sample of plasma, and are instead tested in separate experiments.Objectives and methodsWe evaluated the potential benefits of a combined TG/FG/FL assay by testing responses of normal plasma to a wide range of tissue factor (TF) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) concentrations. Correlations between multiple parameters extracted from the TG and FG/FL curves were also compared.ResultsRate of FG correlated well with TG peak height at all TF concentrations, but correlations between TG and FL parameters depended on the TF concentration. Without thrombomodulin, all FG/FL parameters at high TF could be predicted from TG parameters and no FL protection was observed. With thrombomodulin and high TF, TF-dependent FL protection did not correlate with TF-dependent TG. The fluorogenic thrombin substrate did not interfere with optical density readings, and meaningful tPA concentrations did not interfere with TG readings.ConclusionsIn normal plasma, TG, FG and FL parameters may provide interchangeable information. Evaluation of FL-resistance may provide additional data under special assay conditions, but the value of this information should be studied under disease conditions.",April 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Kevin Z.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Xin'}, {'given-name': 'William C.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Chang'}, {'given-name': 'Mikhail V.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ovanesov'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384815301997,1-s2.0-S0049384815301997
Fibrinolytic PLGA nanoparticles for slow clot lysis within abdominal aortic aneurysms attenuate proteolytic loss of vascular elastic matrix,"AbstractAbdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) involve chronic overexpression of proteases in the aortic wall that result in disruption of elastic fibers and consequent loss of vessel elasticity. Nearly 75% of AAAs contain flow-obstructing, fibrin-rich intraluminal thrombi (ILT), which act as a) a bioinert shield, protecting the underlying AAA wall from high hemodynamic stresses, and b) a reservoir of inflammatory cells and proteases that cause matrix breakdown. For these reasons, restoring flow through the aorta lumen and facilitating transmural diffusion of therapeutics from circulation to the AAA wall must be achieved by slow thrombolysis of the ILT to render it porous without rapid breakdown. Intravenously dosed tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been shown to rapidly lyse ILTs in acute stroke and myocardial infarctions. For future use in opening up AAA segments, in this study, we investigated the ability of tPA released from poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA NPs) to slowly lyse fibrin clots without inducing proteolytic injury and matrix synthesis-inhibitory effects on cultured rat aneurysmal smooth muscle cells (EaRASMCs). Fibrin clot lysis time was greatly extended over that in presence of exogenous tPA. Surface functionalization of NPs with a cationic amphiphile allowed them to bind to anionic fibrin clot, release tPA at a slower rate and to lyse the clot as a front proceeding outwards in unlike the more rapid and homogenous lysis that occurred due to anionic PLGA NPs. Elastic matrix content was decreased in EaRASMC cultures exposed to byproducts of clot lysis with exogenous tPA, but not tPA-NPs, and was likely due to increased proteolytic activity (MMPs, plasmin) in EaRASMC cultures exposed to exogenous tPA-lysed clots. Our results suggest that gradual ILT lysis via slow release of tPA from NPs will be likely beneficial over exogenous tPA delivery in preserving elastic matrix content and attenuating matrilysis in the adjoining AAA wall, in vivo, while rendering the ILT porous to facilitate transmural delivery of endoluminally delivered AAA therapeutics.",1 February 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Balakrishnan', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sivaraman'}, {'given-name': 'Andrew', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sylvester'}, {'given-name': 'Anand', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ramamurthi'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0928493115303829,1-s2.0-S0928493115303829
Clot lysis time and thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor in severe preeclampsia with or without associated antiphospholipid antibodies,"AbstractWe investigated clot lysis time, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor antigen (TAFI) levels and TAFI gene polymorphisms in pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia, with or without associated antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The study groups included 82 pregnant patients without antiphospholipid antibodies with severe preeclampsia (PE group) and 10 pregnant APS patients who developed severe preeclampsia (APS-PE group). Controls included 76 primary pregnant APS patients (APS group) and 89 healthy pregnant patients (NOR group) with uneventful term pregnancy and delivery. Patients in the APS-PE, APS and NOR groups were sampled during each trimester of pregnancy and at 4–6 months and 12 months after delivery. Patients in the PE group were sampled during the third trimester and after delivery. Significantly prolonged clot lysis time after delivery was found in the PE, APS-PE and APS groups compared to the NOR group. The PE and APS-PE groups had longer clot lysis time than the APS group. Levels of TAFI were found to be higher after delivery in patients of the PE and APS-PE groups compared to the APS and NOR groups. Allele distribution of the TAFI gene polymorphisms was similar among the four study groups. We conclude that increased TAFI antigen levels and impaired fibrinolysis are pathogenetic factors in preeclampsia, regardless of whether or not preeclampsia is associated with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies.",November 2010,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'M.

Suramin inhibits antibody binding to cell surface antigens and disrupts complement-mediated mesangial cell lysis,"AbstractSuramin inhibits immune responses and protects cells against inflammatory cell injury. However, little is known about its mechanisms. Using an in vitro model of glomerular mesangial cell (MC) lysis induced by antibodies plus complement, we investigated the potential protective effects and mechanisms of suramin on immunologic cell injury. Exposure of rat MCs to anti-Thy-1 antibody plus complement or anti-MC rabbit serum caused complement-dependent cell lysis, which was blocked by suramin and its structural analogue NF023 and NF049, but not by PPADS, an antagonist of purinergic receptors. Addition of exogenous ATP also failed to affect MC lysis. Further analysis revealed that suramin interfered with antibody binding to cell membrane antigens and suppressed antibody-induced phosphorylation of several proteins, including p38. Inhibition of p38 with chemical inhibitor significantly attenuated cell injury. Collectively, our results indicate that suramin protects cells against antibody-initiated and complement-dependent cell injury through inhibition of antibody binding to cell surface antigens and suppression of p38 activation. Our study thus provides novel mechanistic insights into the actions of suramin and suggests that suramin might be used to treat certain immune diseases.",Available online 30 March 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Honglan', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Piao'}, {'given-name': 'Yuan', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Chi'}, {'given-name': 'Xiling', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Zhang'}, {'given-name': 'Zhen', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Zhang'}, {'given-name': 'Kun', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Gao'}, {'given-name': 'Manabu', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Niimi'}, {'given-name': 'Manabu', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kamiyama'}, {'given-name': 'Jinming', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Zhang'}, {'given-name': 'Masayuki', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Takeda'}, {'given-name': 'Jian', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Yao'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1347861316300056,1-s2.0-S1347861316300056

Whole blood clots are more resistant to lysis than plasma clots - greater efficacy of rivaroxaban,"AbstractIntroductionDefective thrombolysis, a thrombotic risk factor, can be attributed to the formation of a compact clot poorly accessible to fibrinolytic enzymes. Venous thrombi, rich in red blood cells (RBCs), and arterial thrombi containing various amounts of RBCS, plasma and whole blood (WB) clot permeability and degradability were compared. The effect of rivaroxaban, a potent direct factor Xa inhibitor, was also evaluated.Materials and MethodsFibrin permeability was determined by flow measurement through the clot. Clot degradability was evaluated by the amount of D-dimer generated by clot perfusion with plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator. Fibrin clot structure was assessed by confocal microscopy.ResultsWB clot permeability (KS) and degradability were 6.7- and 38-fold lower, respectively, compared with plasma clots. This is attributed to 1) occlusion of fibrin pores by RBCs and 2) a consistent increase in thrombin generation due to platelets and RBCs inducing formation of a tighter clot. Rivaroxaban added to plasma or WB before clotting, in reducing thrombin generation, led to the formation of a looser clot that is more degradable by fibrinolytic enzymes. Permeability and degradability of whole blood clots formed in the presence of rivaroxaban were very similar to those of plasma clots.ConclusionThe resistance to fibrinolysis of WB clots was reduced considerably when clots were formed with rivaroxaban. These results may have implications for the development of antithrombotic agents.",March 2013,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Rémi', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Varin'}, {'given-name': 'ShahSultan', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Mirshahi'}, {'given-name': 'Pezhman', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Mirshahi'}, {'given-name': 'Christophe', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Klein'}, {'given-name': 'Jovid', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Jamshedov'}, {'given-name': 'Jean', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Chidiac'}, {'given-name': 'Elisabeth', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Perzborn'}, {'given-name': 'Massoud', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Mirshahi'}, {'given-name': 'Claudine', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Soria'}, {'given-name': 'Jeannette', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Soria'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004938481200850X,1-s2.0-S004938481200850X

Recanalization with intravascular droplets was achieved in vivo at 24 ± 5% of the sonication power without droplets. Recanalization occurred in 71% of rabbits that received 1-ms pulsed sonications during continuous intravascular droplet infusion (p = 0.041 vs controls).

Direct microscopic monitoring of initial and dynamic clot lysis using plasmin or rt-PA in an in vitro flow system,"AbstractIntroductionPlasmin is a direct-acting thrombolytic agent with a favorable safety profile upon intra-arterial delivery in pre-clinical and phase I studies. However, the thrombolytic efficacy of plasmin, relative to that of rt-PA, remains to be established. We have compared the dynamics of clot lysis with plasmin or rt-PA in an in vitro perfusion system, in which thrombolytic agent is administered locally, allowed to induce lysis for short intervals, then washed with plasma in a re-circulation circuit.Materials and MethodsWhole blood human clots were prepared in observation chambers, exposed to plasmin or rt-PA at equimolar concentrations (1.2/1.0, 1.8/1.5 and 2.4/2.0mg/ml) for measured intervals of time, followed by perfusion with human plasma. Clot size was monitored by digital analysis of sequential photographs obtained through an optical microscope.ResultsPlasma perfusion after incubation with thrombolytic agent rapidly removed superficial clot fragments. This initial decrease in clot size was greater with plasmin than with rt-PA when tested at the highest concentrations of agent (0.63±0.11 vs. 0.30±0.11, p=0.001 for clots with non-cross-linked fibrin and 0.53±0.15 vs. 0.14±0.15, p=0.02, for clots with cross-linked-fibrin). Subsequent clot lysis during plasma flow was greater after prior incubation with rt-PA. Longer incubation times of plasmin resulted in larger portions of the clot being washed free. Repeated plasmin incubations and plasma perfusions of a clot successfully induced stepwise reductions in clot size.ConclusionsInitial clot lysis is greater with direct exposure using plasmin than rt-PA. During washout and circulation with plasma, rt-PA induced continued clot lysis, while plasmin lysis was curtailed, presumably because of plasmin inhibition.",May 2014,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Nina', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bizjak'}, {'given-name': 'Franci', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bajd'}, {'given-name': 'Jernej', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Vidmar'}, {'given-name': 'Aleš', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Blinc'}, {'given-name': 'Maja Pohar', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Perme'}, {'given-name': 'Victor J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Marder'}, {'given-name': 'Valery', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Novokhatny'}, {'given-name': 'Igor', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Serša'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384814000875,1-s2.0-S0049384814000875
In vivo clot lysis of human thrombus with intravenous abciximab immunobubbles and ultrasound,"AbstractAbciximab immunobubbles have been introduced recently for ultrasonographic molecular imaging of human thrombus. This study investigates the potential of using these novel bubbles for enhancing sonothrombolysis. In particular, it addresses the question of whether ligand targeting of bubbles with abciximab improves the effectiveness of lysis with ultrasound.A partial thrombotic occlusion of the right common carotid artery of 16 rats was produced by insertion of human clot material via an external carotid artery catheter. Rats received abciximab immunobubbles, non-specific control immunobubbles or saline intravenously over 30 minutes in combination with pulsed 2 MHz ultrasound. Blood samples were taken at baseline and 5, 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes after beginning treatment. Human D-dimer levels for quantification of thrombolysis were analysed by ELISA.Only animals treated with abciximab immunobubbles and ultrasound showed a significant increase of D-dimer levels over time (p=0.043, linear trend p=0.037), whereas in the other two groups, no significant increase over time was found.Overall, animals in the abciximab immunobubbles group showed higher plasma D-dimer levels than animals treated with non-specific immunobubbles (p=0.049) and animals treated with ultrasound alone (p=0.017).In histological sections, thrombi treated with abciximab immunobubbles and ultrasound showed clear signs of disintegration in contrast to thrombi in both control groups.2 MHz ultrasound in combination with abciximab immunobubbles induces thrombolysis without lytic agents that is superior to insonation of non-specific immunobubbles.",May 2009,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Angelika', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Alonso'}, {'given-name': 'Carl-Erik', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Dempfle'}, {'given-name': 'Alberto', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Della Martina'}, {'given-name': 'Mark', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Stroick'}, {'given-name': 'Marc', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Fatar'}, {'given-name': 'Katrin', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Zohsel'}, {'given-name': 'Eric', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Allémann'}, {'given-name': 'Michael G.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Hennerici'}, {'given-name': 'Stephen', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Meairs'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004938480800546X,1-s2.0-S004938480800546X

Evolution of acute ischemic stroke therapy from lysis to thrombectomy: Similar or different to acute myocardial infarction?,"AbstractAcute ischemic stroke remains a major global cause of death, permanent disability, and dementia. For nearly two decades, intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been the only recommended therapy, albeit administered within the recommended time window (i.e., &lt;4.5h). However, intravenous tPA is associated with modest recanalization rates, with a majority of patients having poor functional outcomes despite timely administration. Endovascular therapy has recently been introduced as adjunctive management of acute ischemic stroke. First generation endovascular thrombectomy devices have failed to improve outcomes compared with intravenous tPA. However, recent randomized trials utilizing stent retrievers demonstrated that these devices improve functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke secondary to large-artery occlusion. Introduction of stent retrieves has begun a new era for acute ischemic stroke therapy. This comprehensive review discusses the evolution of acute ischemic stroke therapy over the last two decades, with emphasis on recent randomized trials evaluating stent retrievers. Additionally, similarities and differences between the evolution of therapy in ST elevation myocardial infarction and acute ischemic stroke will be highlighted.",1 November 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Islam Y.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Elgendy'}, {'given-name': 'Ahmed N.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Mahmoud'}, {'given-name': 'Hend', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Mansoor'}, {'given-name': 'Mohammad K.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Mojadidi'}, {'given-name': 'Anthony A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bavry'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167527316316503,1-s2.0-S0167527316316503
A new euglobulin clot lysis assay for global fibrinolysis,"AbstractPlasma fibrinolytic activity has been measured by the euglobulin clot lysis time (ELT) since the late 1950s. The euglobulin clot lysis assay (ECLA) method has been modified using a computerized kinetic spectrophotometric microtiter plate reader and measures optical density changes of recalcified euglobulin fraction of plasma samples over time. This method has been applied to normal healthy adults, children, pregnant women and newborn infants, which represent physiologic extremes of the ELT. The ECLA method adds measurements of maximum absorbance (Max Abs), area under the curve (AUC) and mean velocity to the standard clot lysis time. The resulting curves are unique to this method and have been analyzed and compared in order to establish normal ranges. Fibrinogen levels, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen, PAI-1 activity and thrombin activatable fibrinolytic inhibitor (TAFI) antigen levels were measured in each individual of the four groups. Each protein measured within each study group except TAFI correlated with the lysis time, maximum absorbance and area under the curve. Considering all four groups together, PAI correlates most highly with lysis time, fibrinogen correlates the highest with Max Abs; fibrinogen and PAI-1 antigen have equally high correlations to AUC. Area under the curve is highly correlated with all coagulation parameters measured; the most significant contributor is fibrinogen. These observations are interesting, but at this time, it cannot be said that any of the test parameters are better than lysis time in distinguishing between these normal physiologic states.",2003,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Amy A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Smith'}, {'given-name': 'Linda J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Jacobson'}, {'given-name': 'Brian I.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Miller'}, {'given-name': 'William E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Hathaway'}, {'given-name': 'Marilyn J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Manco-Johnson'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384804000064,1-s2.0-S0049384804000064
Peroxynitrite may affect fibrinolysis via the reduction of platelet-related fibrinolysis resistance and alteration of clot structure,"AbstractWe tested the hypothesis that in vitro peroxynitrite (ONOO−, a product of activated inflammatory cells) may affect fibrinolysis in human blood through the reduction of platelet-related fibrinolysis resistance. It was found that ONOO− (25–300µM) accelerated lysis of platelet-fibrin clots (in PRP) dose-dependently, whereas fibrinolysis of platelet-free clots was slightly inhibited by ≥1000µM stressor. Concentrations of ONOO− affecting the lysis of platelet-rich clots, inhibited clot retraction (CR) in a dose-dependent manner. Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) measurements performed in PRP showed that treatment with ONOO− (threshold conc. 100µM) prolongs clotting time, and reduces alpha angle, and clot formation velocity parameters indicating for reduced thrombin formation rate. In PRP, ONOO− (threshold conc. 100µM) reduced the collagen-evoked exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on platelets’ plasma membrane, the shedding of platelet-derived microparticles (PMP), and inhibited platelet-dependent thrombin generation (measured in artificial system), dose-dependently. As judged by confocal microscopy, similar ONOO− concentrations altered the architecture of clots formed in collagen-treated PRP. Clots formed in the presence of ONOO− were less dense and were composed of thicker fibers, which make them more susceptible to lysis. In platelet-depleted plasma, ONOO− (up to milimolar concentration) did not alter clot structure. Blockage of PS exposed on platelets resulted in an alteration of clot architecture toward more prone to lysis. ONOO−, at lysis-affecting concentrations, inhibited the collagen-evoked secretion of fibrinolytic inhibitors from platelets. We conclude that physiologically relevant ONOO− concentrations may accelerate the lysis of platelet-fibrin clots predominantly via downregulation of platelet-related mechanisms including: platelet secretion, clot retraction, platelet procoagulant response, and the alteration in clot architecture associated with it.",December 2015,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Tomasz', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Misztal'}, {'given-name': 'Tomasz', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Rusak'}, {'given-name': 'Justyna', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Brańska-Januszewska'}, {'given-name': 'Halina', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ostrowska'}, {'given-name': 'Marian', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Tomasiak'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0891584915005742,1-s2.0-S0891584915005742

Effect of sodium ozagrel on platelet rich plasma clot lysis,"AbstractSodium ozagrel inhibits platelet aggregation through thromboxane (TX) synthetase inhibition. In vitro, the combination of antiplatelet agents with plasminogen activators (PAs) is more effective for thrombolytic therapy than are PAs alone. Therefore, the influence of sodium ozagrel on platelet rich plasma (PRP) clot lysis was investigated in this study. Firstly, PRP clot lysis was performed: PRP clots containing sodium ozagrel were lyzed by a urokinase-type PA. PRP clot lysis was significantly enhanced by sodium ozagrel in a dose-dependent manner. Secondly, clot solubility was investigated by a urea solubility test. The solubility of PRP clots was enhanced by sodium ozagrel in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the influence of sodium ozagrel on the density of PRP clots was studied. The density of the PRP clots was decreased by sodium ozagrel in a dose-dependent manner. PAI-1 antigen which was released from activated platelets was reduced by sodium ozagrel in a dose-dependent manner. These findings indicate that the enhancement of PRP clot lysis by sodium ozagrel is due to enhanced solubility, decreased density and reduced PAI-1 antigen release.",September 1997,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'H', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Yuasa'}, {'given-name': 'K', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Okada'}, {'given-name': 'S', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ueshima'}, {'given-name': 'O', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Matsuo'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0928468097000138,1-s2.0-S0928468097000138
Acute cigarette smoke exposure reduces clot lysis -- association between altered fibrin architecture and the response to t-PA,"AbstractBackgroundEnhanced thrombolysis is a proposed mechanism for reduced mortality in cigarette smokers with STEMI (“smoker's paradox”). The mechanisms remain unclear but studies suggest fibrin architecture (FA) may affect thrombolysis. Our group has previously shown that acute cigarette smoke exposure (CSE) alters FA. This study was done to evaluate the association between FA, thrombolysis and CSE.Methods and ResultsOtherwise healthy smokers (n=22) were studied before and after smoking two cigarettes. Non-smokers (n=22) served as controls. Two ex-vivo models were used to evaluate clot lysis of venous blood and these data were compared to FA as determined by SEM. In the first model, clot lysis in a glass tube at 60minutes after addition of t-PA was measured. The second model quantified lysis utilizing thromboelastography. With the latter, after a clot reached maximum strength, t-PA was added and clot lysis at 60min was noted. SEM studies were performed on platelet poor plasma mixed with thrombin and FA was examined at 20K.Clot lysis was similar in both groups except that post-smoking, TEG showed a significantly lower lysis compared to pre- and non-smoking clots. SEM analysis showed significantly thinner fibers and denser clots post-smoking.ConclusionsVenous clots from smokers failed to show an enhanced lysis when exposed to t-PA. In fact, acute CSE was associated with changes in FA and increased resistance to thrombolysis. These findings in part may explain enhanced thrombogenicity but suggest that mechanisms other than enhanced fibrinolysis are likely to be responsible for “smoker's paradox.”",November 2010,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Rajat S.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Barua'}, {'given-name': 'Fridolin', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sy'}, {'given-name': 'Sundararajan', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Srikanth'}, {'given-name': 'Grace', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Huang'}, {'given-name': 'Usman', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Javed'}, {'given-name': 'Cyrus', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Buhari'}, {'given-name': 'Dennis', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Margosan'}, {'given-name': 'Waqas', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Aftab'}, {'given-name': 'John A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ambrose'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384810004135,1-s2.0-S0049384810004135

Vitamin K antagonists favourably modulate fibrin clot properties in patients with atrial fibrillation as early as after 3days of treatment: Relation to coagulation factors and thrombin generation,"AbstractIntroductionAtrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of thromboembolism that is reduced by vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). We sought to investigate changes in plasma fibrin clot phenotype at the onset of oral anticoagulation.Materials and methodsForty consecutive AF patients (aged 45–83 years, CHA2DS2-VASc score 3.0±1.5) who started therapy with warfarin or acenocoumarol were studied. Plasma fibrin clot permeability (Ks), clot lysis time (CLT), along with clotting factors (F), thrombin generation (TG) profiles and protein C (PC) levels were determined on days 3, 5, 7, 28 and 56±1 since the first dose.ResultsAF patients had 16% higher median of Ks and 15% lower median of CLT as early as on day 3 of VKA therapy compared with the baseline (both p&lt;0.001), reaching the plateau values on day 7 and 5, respectively. Higher Ks values on days 1 and 3 were found in AF patients with further stable anticoagulation (both p&lt;0.05). Moreover, FIX explained 32% of the total variability in Ks. Multivariate analysis adjusted for potential confounders including time as a predictor showed that vitamin K-dependent (VKD) factors, PC and TG parameters were the predictors of Ks (all p&lt;0.0001), while only the lag phase of TG and thrombin peak predicted CLT (both p&lt;0.05) in AF patients. Regression analysis of time-series showed however, that CLT was also predicted by VKD factors and PC (all p&lt;0.05).ConclusionsPlasma fibrin clot properties in AF patients are favourably modified as early as after 3days of VKA administration, which might contribute to antithrombotic effectiveness.",October 2015,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Michał', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ząbczyk'}, {'given-name': 'Jacek', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Majewski'}, {'given-name': 'Grzegorz', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Karkowski'}, {'given-name': 'Krzysztof Piotr', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Malinowski'}, {'given-name': 'Anetta', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Undas'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384815300918,1-s2.0-S0049384815300918
Lysis of surface-localized fibrin clots by adsorbed plasminogen in the presence of tissue plasminogen activator,"AbstractThe ability of plasminogen adsorbed from buffer onto sulphonated silica glass or lysine-derivatized silica glass to lyse fibrin I clots has been investigated. Clots were formed around the test surface by adding reptilase to fibrinogen solutions in which the surfaces were immersed. Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) was then added and the extent of clot lysis was determined by measuring the levels of the specific plasmin cleavage product of fibrinogen, Bβ 1–42 peptide. The data indicate that in the presence of t-PA, Bβ 1–42 generation per mole of bound plasminogen on the lysinized material is approximately two-fold higher than on the sulphonated material. It is concluded that a preformed clot may be lysed by adsorbed plasminogen in the presence of t-PA, and that clot lysis is significantly enhanced when the plasminogen is adsorbed via its lysine binding sites.",January 1996,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'K.A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Woodhouse'}, {'given-name': 'J.I', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Weitz'}, {'given-name': 'J.L', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Brash'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0142961296807599,1-s2.0-0142961296807599
Enhancing effect of platelets on staphylokinase-mediated clot lysis and plasminogen activation,"AbstractThe effects of platelets on clot lysis and plasminogen activation by staphylokinase (SAK) were investigated. At concentrations ranging from 2 × 10−7 to 1 × 10−5g/ml of SAK, the lysis time of platelet-rich plasma clots (PRP-clots) was shorter than that of platelet-poor plasma clots (PPP-clots). This reduction of clot lysis time was observed in a dose-dependent manner on platelet count in PRP. The activation rate of plasminogen by SAK measured by the amidolytic method using S-2251 was enhanced by the addition of washed platelets. These enhancing effects of platelets on clot lysis and plasminogen activation were not altered by pretreatment of platelets with indometacin and theophylline, but were diminished by platelet disruption. Thus, we concluded that platelets enhance fibrinolytic activity of SAK, and this effect is not due to the release reaction or intracellular contents of platelets, but to the existence of platelet surface in the intact shape as a catalytic site for fibrinolysis.",15 October 1995,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Akira', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Suehiro'}, {'given-name': 'Hiroshi', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Tsujioka'}, {'given-name': 'Hiroshi', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Yoshimoto'}, {'given-name': 'Motoo', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ueda'}, {'given-name': 'Satoshi', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Higasa'}, {'given-name': 'Eizo', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kakishita'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004938489500159O,1-s2.0-004938489500159O
"Denser plasma clot formation and impaired fibrinolysis in paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation while on sinus rhythm: Association with thrombin generation, endothelial injury and platelet activation","AbstractIntroductionFormation of compact and poorly lysable fibrin clots have been demonstrated in patients following ischemic stroke. Recently, it has been shown that denser fibrin networks and impaired fibrinolysis occurs in subjects with permanent atrial fibrillation (AF). Fibrin clot phenotype in other types of AF remains to be established. We evaluated fibrin clot properties in paroxysmal (PAF) and persistent AF (PsAF).Material and MethodsWe studied 88 non-anticoagulated patients with AF on sinus rhythm and free of stroke (41 with PAF, 47 with PsAF) versus 50 controls. Ex-vivo plasma fibrin clot permeability (Ks) and clot lysis time (CLT) were evaluated along with von Willebrand factor (vWF), peak thrombin generation (TG), platelet factor 4 (PF4) and fibrinolytic proteins.ResultsCompared with control subjects, clots obtained from plasma of patients with PAF and PsAF had similarly lower Ks (−7.7%, P=0.01; −8.6%, P=0.005, respectively) and prolonged CLT (+10.8%, P=0.006; +7.8% P=0.04, respectively). No associations of Ks and CLT with CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED score were observed. Patients with AF had higher TG, vWF, PF4 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen compared with controls. Multiple linear regression adjusted for age, gender, body mass index and fibrinogen showed that TG (β=−0.41), vWF (β=−0.29) and PF4 (β=−0.28) are the independent predictors of Ks (R2=0.78), while CLT was independently predicted by TG (β=0.37), PAI-1 antigen (β=0.29) and vWF (β=0.26) in the AF group (R2=0.39).ConclusionsPatients with PAF and PsAF while on sinus rhythm display unfavorably altered fibrin clot properties, which might contribute to thromboembolic complications.",August 2015,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Leszek', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Drabik'}, {'given-name': 'Paweł', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Wołkow'}, {'given-name': 'Anetta', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Undas'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384815300062,1-s2.0-S0049384815300062
Inhibitory effects of lysine analogues on t-PA induced whole blood clot lysis,"AbstractThe lysine analogues epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) and trans-4-amino-methyl cyclohexane carboxylic acid (AMCA) are used to prevent excessive bleeding in patients with coagulopathies, such as hemophilia and thrombocytopenia, or in those who have received tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). However, their relative efficacy in inhibiting lysis of clots that have been formed in the presence of exogenous t-PA or that have been formed and then exposed to exogenous t-PA has not been well characterized. The present study utilized blood from normal volunteers and 125I-fibrinogen in a dilute whole blood clot assay to determine the relative concentrations of lysine analogues required for inhibition of clot lysis induced by exogenous t-PA. AMCA (0.06 mM) and EACA (0.6 mM) were effective in prolonging clot lysis if (1) whole blood clots were formed and then exposed to a lysine analogue and exogenous t-PA or if (2) whole blood clots were formed in the presence of exogenous t-PA and a lysine analogue. However, their inhibitory effect was markedly reduced if clots were formed in the presence of t-PA and then exposed to either of the lysine analogues. The analogues did not inhibit the initial binding of t-PA to fibrin. They did inhibit binding of plasminogen to fibrin as well as the activation of plasminogen by t-PA in the absence of fibrin. The data suggest that lysine analogues, even at low concentrations, reduce the rate of t-PA induced whole blood clot lysis by several mechanisms.",15 March 1994,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Chitra', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Krishnamurti'}, {'given-name': 'Svetislava J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Vukelja'}, {'given-name': 'Barbara M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Alving'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0049384894900434,1-s2.0-0049384894900434

The potential role of platelet PAI-1 in t-PA mediated clot lysis of platelet rich plasma,"AbstractThe potential role of platelets in platelet rich plasma clot lysis induced by tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) was investigated. At the various concentrations of both single chain t-PA (sct-PA) and two chain t-PA (tct-PA) (1.5nM, 3nM, and 6nM), we compared the t-PA mediated lysis time of platelet rich plasma clot (PRP-clot) with that of platelet poor plasma clot (PPP-clot). At the concentrations ranged from 1.5 to 6 nM of both types of t-PA, the clot lysis time of PRP-clot was longer than that of PPP-clot. This elongation was more significant in the tct-PA induced clot lysis than that in the sct-PA induced clot lysis. At the concentration of 3nM of tct-PA, the lysis time of PRP-clot was longer by a factor of 30% in comparison with that of PPP-clot. When the release and the aggregation of platelets were blocked by prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and theophylline in this experiment, the lysis time of PRP-clot was essentially the same as that of PPP-clot. We then measured the antigen levels of total PAI-1 and t-PA-PAI-1 complex in the lyzed solutions of PRP-clot and PPP-clot to analyse the possible effect of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) present in platelets. Most of PAI-1 in a PPP-clot lyzed sample existed as t-PA-PAI-1 complex. In the lyzed solution of PRP-clot, however, the antigen levels of both total PAI-1 and t-PA-PAI-1 complex were significantly higher than those in PPP-clot, and larger amounts of PAI-1 existed as free PAI-1 which possesses activity. These data suggest that at least certain amounts of PAI-1 in platelets exist as an active form and inhibits t-PA activity resulting in the prolongation of the clot lysis time. Activation of platelets, therefore, seems to play an important role in the platelet rich plasma clot lysis induced by t-PA.",15 August 1993,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'K.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Serizawa'}, {'given-name': 'T.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Urano'}, {'given-name': 'Y.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kozima'}, {'given-name': 'Y.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Takada'}, {'given-name': 'A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Takada'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004938489390198W,1-s2.0-004938489390198W

Euglobulin clot lysis induced by tissue-type plasminogen activator is reduced in subjects with increased levels of lipoprotein(a),"AbstractSeveral reports have evaluated the in vitro effect of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels on the fibrinolytic system, suggesting that high Lp(a) levels may inhibit fibrinolysis by competing for plasminogen binding in different systems. We have studied plasminogen activation induced by tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), as well as other fibrinolytic parameters, in 25 subjects with Lp(a) levels &gt; 30 mg/dl and the results were compared with those found in 23 subjects with Lp(a) &lt; 30 mg/dl. Both groups were similar in age, sex distribution, living habits and lipid pattern. Plasminogen activation, when measured by t-PA-induced euglobulin clot lysis, was significantly decreased in the group with elevated Lp(a) levels (lysis time, 16.7±3.3 min) compared with the group with low Lp(a) levels (11.8±2.0 min), although 8 of the 25 subjects with high Lp(a) levels showed plasminogen activation within the range of the control group. A positive significant correlation between Lp(a) levels and t-PA-induced euglobulin clot lysis time was found. No statistical differences were demonstrated between groups for the other fibrinolytic parameters studied. Addition of purified Lp(a) to the euglobulin fraction or to plasma resulted in a decrease in euglobulin clot lysis. The present study shows that t-PA induced plasminogen activation is decreased in individuals with high circulating levels of Lp(a) supporting the hypothesis that Lp(a) may interfere with the physiological functions of plasminogen.",1 June 1992,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Justo', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Aznar'}, {'given-name': 'Amparo', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Estellés'}, {'given-name': 'Miguel', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bretó'}, {'given-name': 'Francisco', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Espana'}, {'given-name': 'Trinidad', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Alés'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004938489290311W,1-s2.0-004938489290311W
C1-inhibitor efficiently delays clot development in normal human whole blood and inhibits Escherichia coli-induced coagulation measured by thromboelastometry,"AbstractIntroductionC1-inhibitor (C1-INH), a serine protease inhibitor in plasma plays a central role in the cross-talk among the complement, coagulation, fibrinolytic and kallikrein-kinin systems. However, previous reports indicate thrombotic risks in children following supraphysiological dosing with C1-INH. Objective: To investigate the role of supraphysiological C1-INH concentrations in clot development with and without addition of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in fresh human whole blood using thromboelastometry.Materials and methodsBlood was collected in citrate tubes, and C1-INH (3.0 to 47.6μM) or human serum albumin (HSA) was added as a control. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was analysed in the plasma. The analyses non-activated thromboelastometry (NATEM), extrinsic (EXTEM) or intrinsic thromboelastometry (INTEM) were performed using rotational thromboelastometry.ResultsC1-INH increased aPTT 1.8-fold (p&lt; 0.05), whereas HSA had no effect. C1-INH increased NATEM clotting time (CT) from 789s to 2025 s (p&lt; 0.05) in a dose-dependent manner. C1-INH reduced the NATEM alpha angle from 47 to 28° (p&lt;0.05) and increased the NATEM clot formation time from 261s to 595s (p&lt; 0.05).

"Lysine-PEG-modified polyurethane as a fibrinolytic surface: Effect of PEG chain length on protein interactions, platelet interactions and clot lysis","AbstractFibrinolytic polyurethane surfaces were prepared by conjugating lysine to the distal terminus of surface-grafted poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Conjugation was through the α-amino group leaving the ε-amino group free. Lysine in this form is expected to adsorb both plasminogen and t-PA specifically from blood. It was shown in previous work that the PEG spacer, while effectively resisting nonspecific protein adsorption, was a deterrent to the specific binding of plasminogen. In the present work, the effects of PEG spacer chain length on the balance of nonspecific and specific protein binding were investigated. PEG–lysine (PEG-Lys) surfaces were prepared using PEGs of different molecular weight (PEG300 and PEG1000). The lysine-derivatized surfaces with either PEG300 or PEG1000 as spacer showed good resistance to fibrinogen in buffer. The PEG300-Lys surface adsorbed plasminogen from plasma more rapidly than the PEG1000-Lys surface. The PEG300-Lys was also more effective in lysing fibrin formed on the surface. These results suggest that the optimum spacer length for protein resistance and plasminogen binding is relatively short. Immunoblots of proteins eluted after plasma contact confirmed that the PEG–lysine surface adsorbed plasminogen while resisting most of the other plasma proteins. The hemocompatibility of the optimized PEG–lysine surface was further assessed in whole blood experiments in which fibrinogen adsorption and platelet adhesion were measured simultaneously. Platelet adhesion was shown to be strongly correlated with fibrinogen adsorption. Platelet adhesion was very low on the PEG-containing surfaces and neither surface-bound lysine nor adsorbed plasminogen promoted platelet adhesion.",July 2009,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Dan', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Li'}, {'given-name': 'Hong', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Chen'}, {'given-name': 'W.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Glenn McClung'}, {'given-name': 'John L.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Brash'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1742706109000981,1-s2.0-S1742706109000981

A modified quantitative whole blood clot lysis method for general laboratory analysis of fibrinolysis,"AbstractBecause fibrinolysis is now recognized as an important factor in hypercoagulable states, we have developed and characterized an easily performed, rapid, and quantitative screening test that assesses a patient's fibrinolytic activity. This modification of the dilute whole blood clotting time (DWBCT) counts the number of intact erythrocytes released from the clot formed in samples obtained before and after the application of a venous occlusion cuff. Samples were corrected for the plasma volume changes that occurred during venous occlusion. This test was performed on nine healthy volunteers. Specimens were diluted 1:1 with PBS, rapidly clotted with thrombin and incubated at 37 C. Starting thirty minutes after the thrombin was added and then at twenty minute intervals until 110 minutes, the number of RBCs released from the clot were counted using a Coulter S Plus counter. There were consistently more RBCs released at each time period after venous occlusion (p&lt;0.001). Aliquots were also obtained for measuring PAI activity and TPA levels. PAI activity was lower post-cuff at every point (p&lt;0.001). TPA level was higher at every point (p&lt;0.001) post-cuff. The addition of exogenous TPA, activated protein C, or anti-PAI antibodies increased the amount of clot lysis; while the addition of anti-TPA antibodies and EACA each prevented the post-cuff increase. Unlike the euglobulin lysis time (ELT) this modified DWBCT (mDWBCT) measures the patients intact fibrinolytic system, including PAI and erythrocytes, in a quantitative fashion. Unlike either the ELT or the DWBCT the mDWBCT can be performed within two hours, so results are rapidly available for clinical decisions.

Reduced plasma fibrin clot permeability and susceptibility to fibrinolysis are associated with increased intima-media thickness in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome,"AbstractIntroductionFormation of denser fibrin networks displaying impaired lysability has been reported in subjects at an increased risk of atherosclerosis. Given recent data on prothrombotic fibrin clot phenotype reported in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), we tested the hypothesis that altered fibrin clot properties are associated with increased intima-media thickness (IMT) observed in PAPS.Materials and methodsWe studied 30 consecutive patients with PAPS and 30 controls matched for age, sex and the type of previous thromboembolism. We assessed plasma fibrin clot permeability (Ks) and clot lysis time (CLT) with their potential determinants. The IMT was measured in 3 segments of the carotid arteries.ResultsPatients with APS had 15.2% lower Ks (p=0.002) and 9.7% prolonged CLT (p=0.039) compared with controls. The IMT in the APS group was greater in the common carotid artery (5.7%; p=0.002), at the bifurcation (17.46%; p&lt;0.001), and the internal artery (9.26%; p=0.015). Patients with triple positivity in the antiphospholipid antibody profile (n=9; 30%) had lower Ks and greater IMT (both, p&lt;0.05), compared with those with single positivity (n=13; 43.3%). Multivariate analysis adjusted for potential confounders showed that in APS patients, oxidized low-density lipoproteins (p=0.019) were the only independent predictor of Ks, while thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor activity (p&lt;0.001) predicted CLT. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) was found to be the independent predictor of the IMT in the common carotid artery (p=0.004), and in the internal carotid artery (p&lt;0.001).ConclusionsReduced Ks and susceptibility to lysis are associated with greater IMT in PAPS, which might contribute to the early atherosclerosis in this disease.",November 2014,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Michal', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Asztabski'}, {'given-name': 'Ewa', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Wypasek'}, {'given-name': 'Michał', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ząbczyk'}, {'given-name': 'Anetta', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Undas'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384814004435,1-s2.0-S0049384814004435
CVD risk factors are related to plasma fibrin clot properties independent of total and or γ’ fibrinogen concentration,"AbstractIntroductionCardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors are associated with total fibrinogen concentration and/or altered clot structure. It is however, unclear whether such associations with clot structure are ascribed to fibrinogen concentration or other independent mechanisms. We aimed to determine whether CVD risk factors associated with increased total and/or γ’ fibrinogen concentration, were also associated with altered fibrin clot properties and secondly whether such associations were due to the fibrinogen concentration or through independent associations.Materials and methodsIn a plasma setting CVD risk factors (including total and γ’ fibrinogen concentration) were cross-sectionally analysed in 2010 apparently healthy black South African participants. Kinetics of clot formation (lag time, slope and maximum absorbance) as well as clot lysis times were calculated from turbidity curves.ResultsOf the measured CVD risk factors age, metabolic syndrome, C-reactive protein (CRP), high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and homocysteine were significantly associated with altered fibrin clot properties after adjustment for total and or γ’ fibrinogen concentration. Aging was associated with thicker fibres (p=0.004) while both metabolic syndrome and low HDL-cholesterol levels were associated with lower rates of lateral aggregation (slope), (p=0.0004 and p=0.0009), and the formation of thinner fibres (p=0.007 and p=0.0004). Elevated CRP was associated with increased rates of lateral aggregation (p=0.002) and consequently thicker fibres (p&lt;0.0001). Hyperhomocysteinemia was associated with increased rates of lateral aggregation (p=0.0007) without affecting fibre thickness.ConclusionFinal clot structure may contribute to increased CVD risk in vivo through associations with other CVD risk factors independent from total or γ’ fibrinogen concentration.",November 2014,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Retha C.M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kotzé'}, {'given-name': 'Robert A.S.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ariëns'}, {'given-name': 'Zelda', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'de Lange'}, {'given-name': 'Marlien', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Pieters'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004938481400454X,1-s2.0-S004938481400454X

A comparison between the effects of antithrombin III deficiency and protein C deficiency","AbstractA mathematical model comprised of 23 reaction–diffusion equations is used to simulate the biochemical changes and transport of various reactants involved in coagulation and fibrinolysis in quiescent plasma. The growth and lysis of a thrombus, as portrayed by the model equations, is governed by boundary conditions that include the surface concentration of TF–VIIa, the generation of XIa by contact activation (in vitro), and the secretion of tPA due to endothelial activation. We apply the model to two clinically relevant hypercoagulable states, caused by deficiency of either antithrombin III or protein C. These predictions are compared with published experimental data which validate the utility of the developed model under the special case of static conditions.

Reduced clot permeability and susceptibility to lysis in patients with acute coronary syndrome: Effects of inflammation and oxidative stress,"AbstractBackgroundStable angina is associated with unfavorable fibrin structure/function. It is not known how acute coronary syndromes (ACS) affect fibrin architecture.ObjectiveWe investigated fibrin clot properties and their determinants in ACS patients.Patients and methodsClot permeability, turbidity and fibrinolysis were assessed in 40 patients with ACS versus 40 controls with stable angina matched for age, sex, and risk factors.ResultsPatients with ACS had lower clot permeability (p=0.001), faster fibrin polymerization (p=0.008), and prolonged fibrinolysis time (p&lt;0.0001) than controls. C-reactive protein (CRP) and 8-epi-prostaglandin F2α, a marker of oxidative stress, were the only independent predictors of clot permeability (R2=−0.74; p&lt;0.0001 and R2=−0.65; p&lt;0.0001, respectively) and fibrinolysis time in ACS patients (R2=0.60; p&lt;0.0001 and R2=0.59; p=0.0002, respectively). In angina patients, fibrinogen and CRP predicted permeability (R2=−0.71; p&lt;0.0001 and R2=−0.62; p&lt;0.0001), and D-dimer predicted lysis time (R2=0.54; p=0.0005). In regression analysis models incorporating all patients, the only independent predictor of all clot variables was being an ACS patient (R2 0.51 to 0.85; p&lt;0.001).ConclusionsThis first study of clot properties in patients during an ACS demonstrated that compared with stable angina patients, their clots are composed of dense networks that are more resistant to lysis and these features are correlated with raised CRP and oxidative stress.",February 2008,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Anetta', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Undas'}, {'given-name': 'Konstanty', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Szułdrzynski'}, {'given-name': 'Ewa', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Stepien'}, {'given-name': 'Jarosław', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Zalewski'}, {'given-name': 'Jacek', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Godlewski'}, {'given-name': 'Wiesława', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Tracz'}, {'given-name': 'Mieczysław', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Pasowicz'}, {'given-name': 'Krzysztof', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Zmudka'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021915007003814,1-s2.0-S0021915007003814
Effect of fibrin-targeting on clot lysis with urokinase-type plasminogen activator,"AbstractThe effect of fibrin-targeting of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) on its fibrinolytic potency was studied using recombinant fusion proteins of u-PA with the NH2-terminal region of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA/u-PA) and chemical complexes of u-PA with F(ab′)2 fragments of a fibrin specific monoclonal antibody (u-PA/MA-15C5-F(ab′)2). Two chain derivatives of a low Mr variant of u-PA comprising amino acids Leu144-Leu411 (tcu-PA-32k), obtained by cleavage of recombinant single-chain u-PA (rscu-PA-32k) with thrombin (rtcu-PA-32k/T) or plasmin (rtcu-PA-32k/P) were investigated.The plasmin-derived two chain u-PA moieties, rtcu-PA-32k/P, rt-PA/tcu-PA-32k/P and rtcu-PA-32k/MA-15C5-F(ab′)2/P had high specific activities in amidolytic and fibrin plate assays (130,000 and 150,000 IU/mg u-PA, 43,000 and 71,000 IU/mg u-PA and 32,000 and 56,000 IU/mg u-PA respectively). The thrombin-derived two chain u-PA moieties had a very low amidolytic activity, corresponding to ≤ 1 percent of that of their plasmin-derived counterparts. On fibrin plates, however, rtcu-PA-32k/T had a negligible activity, whereas rt-PA/tcu-PA-32k/T and rtcu-PA-32k/MA-15C5-F(ab′)2/T had specific activities of 12,000 and 25,000 IU/mg u-PA respectively. The catalytic efficiency for plasminogen activation of rtcu-PA-32k/MA-15C5-F(ab′)2/T is 4,000-fold lower than that of rtcu-PA-32k/MA-15C5-F(ab')2/P, but its concentration required for 50 percent lysis in 2 hours of a 125I-fibrin labeled plasma clot in human plasma (C50) is only 25-fold higher. The catalytic efficiency of rt-PA/tcu-PA-32k/T is 1,600-fold lower and the C50 100-fold higher than that of rt-PA/tcu-PA-32k/P. The catalytic efficiency and the fibrinolytic potential of rtcu-PA-32k/T are negligible as compared to that of rtcu-PA-32k/P.These observations may be explained by conversion of the thrombin derived two chain u-PA moeities to their plasmin-derived analogues at the fibrin surface. This conversion appears to be most efficient for the antibody conjugate which has a high fibrin-affinity, less efficient for the t-PA/u-PA chimera which has only moderate fibrin-affinity, and negligible for the unconjugated u-PA moiety which has no fibrin-affinity. These findings illustrate the importance of plasmin-mediated positive feedback mechanisms in u-PA mediated clot lysis.",1 February 1990,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'H.R.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Lijnen'}, {'given-name': 'M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Dewerchin'}, {'given-name': 'F.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'De Cock'}, {'given-name': 'D.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Collen'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004938489090249C,1-s2.0-004938489090249C
Accelerated thrombus lysis in the blood of plasminogen activator inhibitor deficient mice is inhibited by PAI-1 with a very long half-life,"AbstractPatients with defective plasminogen activator inhibitor protein (PAI-1) or with PAI-1 deficiency can experience hemorrhage as a result of a hyperfibrinolysis. In these patients, a normal thrombus forms, but endogenous lysis is unchecked as tissue plasminogen activator is unopposed. Treatment includes anti-fibrinolytic agents, including oral tranexamic acid. Another treatment option is the administration of PAI-1, but this serpin rapidly inactivates itself. We have developed a mutant plasminogen activator inhibitor with a very long half life (VLHL PAI-1, t1/2&gt;700h). Here we investigate VLHL PAI-1 effects in the blood of PAI-1 deficient mice, as a model of human disease. Using a thrombelastograph, we found that blood clots of PAI-1 knockout mice were lysed much more quickly than wild type mice. Additionally, blood clots had less shear elastic modulus strength than clots of normal animals. VLHL PAI-1 treatment of PAI-1 deficient mice extended or prevented thrombus lysis and increased clot strength in a concentration dependent fashion. These two parameters determine the extent of thrombus growth and regression; thus, further testing is anticipated to confirm the effectiveness of plasminogen activator inhibitor with a very long half life in an in vivo model and we hope that this protein can be effective in human PAI-1 deficiency disorder.",July–August 2009,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Jerzy', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Jankun'}, {'given-name': 'Ansari', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'M.

Platelet-related fibrinolysis resistance in patients suffering from PV. Impact of clot retraction and isovolemic erythrocytapheresis,"AbstractUsing patients with polycythemia vera (PV) as an experimental model, we evaluated the impact of clot retraction (CR) and architecture of the clot on fibrinolysis. We studied the kinetics of clot retraction and the fibrinolysis rate in whole blood from 48 PV patients and 48 healthy controls. Measurements were performed before and after isovolemic eryhrocytapheresis (ECP). CR was measured by optical method. Clot lysis time (CLT) and maximum clot firmness (MCF) were measured by thromboelastometry in recalcified blood supplemented with t-PA and tissue factor.Compared with healthy controls, CR rate in PV patients was higher (0.0219 vs. 0.0138; p&lt;0.001), the clot volume smaller and MCF elevated (64 vs. 58mm). CR rate correlated with platelet count (r=0.546; p=0.001) but not with erythrocyte concentration (r=0.192; p&gt;0.3). Compared with healthy controls, CLT in PV patients was significantly prolonged (158min vs. 71min). Fibrinolysis rate inversely correlated with CR rate (r=-0.566; p&lt;0.001); MCF (r=-0.704; p&lt;0.001) and platelet count (r=-0.461; p&lt;0.001). As judged by confocal microscope, in comparison to healthy controls, clots formed in blood from PV patients demonstrated booth a distinctly higher degree of crosslinking and possessed thinner fibers. Altered CR, MCF and fibrinolysis speeds were not normalized following the ECP procedure. Tirofiban (a blocker of platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptors), unlike aspirin, normalized abnormal CR and fibrinolysis in blood from PV patients. Collectively, our data indicate that in PV patients, abnormal CR may result in formation of thrombi that are more resistant to fibrinolysis. ECP and aspirin failed to normalize platelet-related fibrinolysis resistance.",July 2014,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Tomasz', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Rusak'}, {'given-name': 'Jarosław', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Piszcz'}, {'given-name': 'Tomasz', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Misztal'}, {'given-name': 'Justyna', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Brańska-Januszewska'}, {'given-name': 'Marian', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Tomasiak'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384814002394,1-s2.0-S0049384814002394

Contact Activation Prolongs Clot Lysis Time in Human Plasma: Role of Thrombin-activatable Fibrinolysis Inhibitor and Factor XIII,"BackgroundContact activation system proteins (e.g., Factor XII, kallikrein) have been implicated as direct or indirect activators of plasminogen. However, contact activation and Factor XI have enhanced thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) activation and decreased fibrinolysis, and Factor XIII (FXIII) also delays fibrinolysis via α2-anti-plasmin deposition on fibrin polymers. Thus, the goals of this study were to define how fibrinolysis is modulated in human plasma by contact or tissue factor (TF) activation, and what role TAFI and FXIII plays in this system.MethodsNormal, TAFI-deficient and TAFI-deficient/FXIII-supplemented plasma was exposed to tissue-type plasminogen activator and activated with either celite or TF. Clot growth/disintegration kinetics were documented with thrombelastography.ResultsNormal plasma activated with celite had significantly prolonged onset and duration of clot lysis compared with samples activated with TF. TAFI-deficient plasma activated with celite was noted to have a duration of clot lysis not different from samples activated with TF, but a significant difference in time to onset of lysis persisted. Celite activation of TAFI-deficient/FXIII-supplemented plasma showed significantly prolonged onset and duration of clot lysis compared with samples activated with TF.ConclusionsPrimarily TAFI, and to a lesser extent FXIII, contributed to contact system protein-mediated attenuation of fibrinolysis. Clinical investigation of these phenomena is warranted in clinical settings involving contact activation (e.g., intra-aortic balloon pumps and ventricular assist devices) to determine whether these devices modulate fibrinolysis and perhaps contribute to thromboembolic morbidity.",October 2006,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Vance G.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Nielsen'}, {'given-name': 'Brad L.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Steenwyk'}, {'given-name': 'William Q.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Gurley'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053249806004888,1-s2.0-S1053249806004888
Whole blood clot lysis: In vitro modulation by activated protein C,"AbstractLysis of clots prepared from native or citrated whole blood as measured by release of 125I fibrinogen degradation products was 10% or less at 20 hours. Lysis of these clots was accelerated by activated protein C in a dose-dependent manner (0.1 to 20 μg/ml) from less than 10% to 60–80% at 20 hours. Lysis of clots prepared from native or citrated platelet poor plasma across the same concentration range of activated protein C was less than 15%. Gla-domainless activated protein C was equally effective in accelerating clot lysis whereas DIP-activated protein C or factor Xa did not accelerate clot lysis. This suggested that this action of activated protein C was enzymatic and this this action was limited to protein C among the vitamin K dependent proteins.The unresponsiveness of platelet poor plasma to activated protein C was completely restored to that of whole blood by addition of mononuclear leukocytes. Addition of red corpuscles or platelets alone had no effect on this response, while addition of polymorphonuclear leukocytes partially restored this response. Addition of metabolic inhibitors 2-deoxyglucose and oligomycin inhibited the response of whole blood and of plasma-mononuclear leukocytes to activated protein C. Reconstitution studies of platelet poor plasma made deficient in plasminogen activator and plasminogen showed that accelerated clot lysis produced by mononuclear leukocytes and activated protein C required the presence of plasminogen. We concluded, therefore, that activated protein C accelerates whole blood or plasma-leukoycte clot lysis by modulating activation of the plasminogen system by metabolically active leukocytes.",15 March 1985,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Fletcher B.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Taylor'}, {'given-name': 'Marion S.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Lockhart'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0049384885901938,1-s2.0-0049384885901938

Lysine-derivatized polyurethane as a clot lysing surface: conversion of adsorbed plasminogen to plasmin and clot lysis in vitro,"AbstractPolyurethane surfaces to which lysine residues are immobilized by photochemical methods are proposed as a basis for clot lysing surfaces. The lysines are attached in such a way that the ε-amino and carboxyl groups are free. We showed previously that these surfaces, when placed in contact with plasma, adsorb only plasminogen and virtually no other proteins (McClung et al., J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 49 (2000) 409). In this communication, data based on a chromogenic substrate assay are presented showing that plasminogen adsorbed to these surfaces is readily converted to plasmin in the presence of tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA). Moreover, the rate of activation on the surface is considerably greater than in solution. Experiments demonstrating the ability of these surfaces to dissolve fibrin clots are also reported. Surfaces exposed to plasma and then to t-PA were placed in citrated plasma. On recalcification, clotting was initiated, but the incipient clots were soon dissolved.

The effect of 40 kHz ultrasound on tissue plasminogen activator-induced clot lysis in three in vitro models,"AbstractIn a previous study, high-frequency ultrasound (US) (3 MHz) was shown to enhance in vitro fibrinolysis through enhanced supply of plasminogen to the clot surface. The application of high-frequency US is limited in vivo, however, due to tissue heating. We continued our research using low-frequency US with less tissue heating and improved penetration of the US. Three different in vitro models, internal plasma clot lysis and external lysis with compacted and noncompacted plasma clots, were used to determine the magnitude of the effect of low-frequency US (40 kHz; 0.5 W/cm2) on tissue plasminogen activator-induced lysis and to elucidate the mechanisms behind the effect. US enhanced lysis in all three models, with the largest effects (fourfold) being in the compacted plasminogen-poor clot model. Plasminogen supply to the clot surface was again shown to be an important contributor to US-enhanced lysis.

Automated alkaline lysis for industrial scale cGMP production of pharmaceutical grade plasmid-DNA,"AbstractPlasmid DNA for biopharmaceutical applications is mainly produced in E. coli cells. The first and most crucial step for recovering the plasmid is the cell lysis. Governed by the physico-chemical properties of the polynucleotide, alkaline lysis has been the lysis-method of choice. This chemical disintegration technique was initially developed for the lab scale and non-pharmaceutical applications. A continuous, fully automated and closed system combining alkaline lysis, neutralization and clarification in one gentle and generic operation was developed. This system consists of a three units. One unit controls mixing and contact time during the alkaline treatment, another one controls the neutralization and the concurrent formation of flocs and a third one the separation of flocs and pDNA containing lysate. Based on optimization experiments the selected process parameters resulted in yields up to 100% and homogeneities comparable to that obtained by gentle manual lysis. The process does not need enzymes and it is scalable and routinely used for cGMP-production of pharmaceutical grade plasmid DNA from 200L fermentations.",30 January 2007,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Jochen', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Urthaler'}, {'given-name': 'Christine', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ascher'}, {'given-name': 'Helga', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Wöhrer'}, {'given-name': 'Roman', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Necina'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168165606007309,1-s2.0-S0168165606007309
Altered plasma fibrin clot properties in patients with digestive tract cancers: Links with the increased thrombin generation,"AbstractObjectivesEvidence indicates that cancer patients have increased thromboembolic risk. Given a potential role of prothrombotic clot phenotype in thrombosis, we investigated plasma fibrin clot properties in patients with digestive tract cancer (DTC).MethodsWe studied 44 consecutive patients with DTC, including 26 subjects with colorectal cancer, versus 47 controls matched for demographics and cardiovascular risk factors. We evaluated ex vivo plasma fibrin clot permeability (Ks), turbidimetry (lag phase and maximum absorbance, ΔAbs), and efficiency of fibrinolysis using 3 different measures (CLT, t50% and maximum rate of d-dimer release from clots, d-Drate).ResultsPatients with DTC had lower Ks (−11.5%, p=0.016), shorter lag phase (−5%, p=0.019), longer CLT (+17%, p&lt;0.001) and t50% (+8%, p=0.031), and reduced d-Drate (−12%, p&lt;0.001) compared with controls. After adjustment for potential confounders, thrombin–antithrombin (TAT) complexes were the independent predictor of CLT and t50% in the patients, while Ks was independently associated with tissue plasminogen activator but not with TAT. In high grade tumor patients (n=26) compared with the remainder (n=18), Ks was lower (p=0.004), and lag phase shorter (p=0.03), while CLT (p=0.012) and t50% (p=0.008) were longer, suggesting more profound unfavorable alterations in fibrin clots properties.ConclusionsThis study is the first to show that patients with DTC tend to form less permeable fibrin clots relatively resistant to lysis.

Altered lysis resistance of platelet-rich clots in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,"AbstractThe fibrinolytic resistance of platelet-rich arterial thrombi received much attention. Clot lysis method was used to assess the in vitro fibrinolytic properties in diabetes mellitus. Platelet rich (PRP) clots were formed by addition of thrombin, and lysis was induced by tissue-plasminogen-activator. The coagulation and lysis was followed by the light scattering properties. A special pattern of good initial lysis followed by a second clotting phase was observed in more than half of insulin dependent diabetic patients, while a similar pattern of clot-lysis was only occasionally found in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus or in the healthy control group. Following the thrombin activation of washed, gel-filtered platelets, the supernatants possessed an inhibitory action on in vitro lysis of PPP-clots. This suppression was remarkably stronger in IDDM, along with the highest PAI-1 activity concentration ratio of the platelet lysates, compared to plasmatic levels.

Dilute blood clot lysis time and electrophoretic lipoprotein fractions in a population sample of healthy Romanians,"AbstractSerum total lipids and cholesterol, electrophoretically determined lipoprotein concentrations, serum pseudocholinesterase and dilute blood clot lysis time were determined in 630 healthy subjects (287 men and 343 women) aged 20–60, working in the food industry. A high incidence of over-weight was noted ranging from 22.4% in women aged 20–40 to 58.7% in men aged 41–60. Over-weight subjects presenting higher levels of serum cholesterol, total lipids and of the pre-beta electrophoretic fraction also had a higher pseudo-cholinesterase activity and a more delayed clot lysis time than normal-weight subjects matched as to age and sex. When the material was divided into quintiles for pre-beta- and beta-lipoproteins, a highly significant delay of fibrinolysis was noted in the fourth and fifth quintiles for pre-beta-lipoproteins, but no significant changes of lysis time occurred with increasing concentrations of beta-lipoproteins.

Fibrin clot properties in women heterozygous for factor V Leiden mutation: Effects of oral contraceptives,"AbstractIntroductionOral contraceptives (OC) in the presence of factor V Leiden mutation (FVL) markedly increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Little is known about the OC and FVL-related alterations in fibrin clot properties.Subjects and MethodsPlasma fibrin clot permeability (Ks) and efficiency of lysis, reflected by clot lysis time (CLT) and the rate of D-dimer release from clots (D-Drate) induced by recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) were determined in 25 women with a family history of VTE who were heterozygous for FVL [FVL(+/−) – twice, on third-generation OC and after their discontinuation. Female non-carriers of FVL, matched for demographics, using OC and after their discontinuation served as controls (n=25). All participants had no personal history of VTE.ResultsOC discontinuation in FVL(+/−) women resulted in shortened CLT (−9%), and increased Ks (+4%) and D-Drate (+1.4%; all p&lt;0.01). Alterations in fibrin clot properties were associated with decreased prothrombin fragments 1+2 (F1+2) (−8%), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen (−11%), and thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) activity (−20%; all p&lt;0.01). During OC use FVL(+/−) carriers compared with non-carriers had higher platelet count, activity of PAI-1, TAFI, and tPA, as well as prolonged CLT and higher D-Dmax, along with lower D-Drate and Ks. Multiple regression analysis adjusted for fibrinogen and age, showed that PAI-1 antigen and TAFI activity independently predicted CLT in FVL(+/−) women on OC.ConclusionFVL(+/−) is associated with hypofibrinolysis in apparently healthy women and third-generation OC administration unfavorably alters plasma clot characteristics in female FVL(+/−) carriers with a family history of thrombotic events.",October 2012,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Marzena', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Krzek'}, {'given-name': 'Mariola', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ciesla-Dul'}, {'given-name': 'Michal', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Zabczyk'}, {'given-name': 'Anetta', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Undas'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384812006780,1-s2.0-S0049384812006780

Reduced clot-stability during the first 6hours after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage – a prospective case-control study,"AbstractIntroductionEarly rebleeding is an important cause of death and disability following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Recent studies have shown that 50-90% of the rebleedings occurred within the first 6hours after the primary bleeding. The mechanism leading to rebleeding remains to be established. In the present prospective case-control study we hypothesize that patients with SAH develop a coagulopathy characterized by reduced clot stability during the early period after the initial bleeding.MethodsPatients with aneurysmal SAH was studied with a dynamic clot lysis assay and markers of fibrinolysis and clot stabilizers in blood samples taken within and after 6hours after onset of bleeding. Results were compared with blood samples from age and gender matched healthy controls.Results36 patients were enrolled, 26 patients had blood samples collected within 6hours after the initial bleeding whereas 10 patients had blood samples taken later than 6hours after the initial bleeding. Patients demonstrated significantly reduced clot stability during the first 6hours after initial bleeding. Fibrinolytic activity was increased during the first 6hours along with the inhibitors of fibrinolysis whereas the modulators of fibrinolysis were reduced or inactivated.ConclusionDuring the first 6hours after SAH patients exhibit reduced clot-stability.

Molecular transport during fibrin clot lysis,"AbstractFibrin clot lysis is a dynamic process in which transport of fibrinolytic proteins plays an important role. Various recently established transport processes for plasminogen as well as for tissue-type and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (t-PA and u-PA, respectively) are reviewed.During internal lysis of a plasma clot, plasminogen is translocated from the fluid phase to the surface of the lysing fibrin fibres. During external lysis, plasminogen strongly accumulates on the moving surface of the clot. In both types of lysis, binding takes place on C-terminal lysine residues in partially degraded fibrin that are generated by plasmin. The recently discovered thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) inhibits plasminogen binding by removing the C-terminal lysine residues. TAFI is a plasma carboxypeptidase B that is activated by thrombin and that links the coagulation system and the fibrinolytic system.Transport of plasminogen activators is, in particular, essential for external clot lysis as it occurs during thrombolytic therapy. Because transport of proteins is not only mediated by diffusion, but also by fluid permeation, flow strongly promotes clot lysis. Penetration of plasminogen activators into clots is hampered by fibrin binding. While t-PA sticks to the surface of a clot, u-PA is able to enter a clot unhindered.Recent studies show that ultrasound promotes plasminogen activator-induced clot lysis. A variety of mechanisms have been proposed to explain this promotion. Results indicate that an increased transport of fibrinolytic proteins significantly contributes to the acceleration of fibrinolysis by ultrasound.",March 2000,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'D.C.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Rijken'}, {'given-name': 'D.V.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sakharov'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0268949900900729,1-s2.0-S0268949900900729
A Reconstituted Dilute Blood Clot Lysis Assay for the Medium Throughput Screening of Thrombolytic Compounds,"AbstractAntithrombotic and clotting factors have long been targets for drug discovery, necessitating the development of blood assays to determine the efficacy of lead compounds prior to animal testing. We have developed a reconstituted blood clot lysis assay which eliminates the need for on-site donors. The assay uses whole blood stored at 4°C obtained from a local blood bank, diluted 1:10 in phosphate buffer. This blood was supplemented with125I-labeled fibrinogen and the release of radioactive fibrinopeptides from formed clots was measured. The whole blood used in this assay, which had been stored at 4°C for several days, no longer formed solid or retracting clots. Thus, platelets 5–7 daysex vivo(165 × 106platelets) were added to the whole blood in the presence of thrombin (0.80 IU/ml) to form clots. Solid clots formed within 2 min of thrombin addition and began retracting shortly thereafter. In the absence of any thrombolytic agent, clots fully retracted within 2.5 h and remained stable. Thrombin-stimulated clot formation was completely inhibited by heparin. Clots could be lysed in a dose-dependent fashion in the presence of tissue-type plasminogen activator. Clot lysis could be completely inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion with plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1. To demonstrate the utility of this assay as a screen for thrombolytic agents, a 14-amino-acid PAI-1-inhibitory peptide relieved the PAI-1 effect on tPA in a dose-dependent fashion. These data describe an assay for the screening of potential pro-fibrinolytic agents that target PAI-1 inhibition in a human plasma-based system that is versatile, cost-effective, and physiologically relevant and does not rely on the availability of on-site blood donors.",15 May 1999,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Albert P.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Gadbut'}, {'given-name': 'John R.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Schullek'}, {'given-name': 'Arthur M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Hanel'}, {'given-name': 'David R.E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'MacAllan'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003269799940654,1-s2.0-S0003269799940654
Anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrinolytic effects of thrombomodulin alfa through carboxypeptidase B2 in the presence of thrombin,"AbstractBackgroundThrombomodulin (TM) alfa, a recombinant human soluble TM, enhances activation of pro-carboxypeptidase B2 (pro-CPB2) by thrombin. Activated pro-CPB2 (CPB2) exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrinolytic activities. Therefore, TM alfa may also have anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrinolytic effects through CPB2. However, these effects of TM alfa have not been elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the effects of TM alfa on inactivation of complement component C5a as an anti-inflammatory effect and prolongation of clot lysis time as an anti-fibrinolytic effect via CPB2 in vitro.MethodsCPB2 activity and tissue factor-induced thrombin generation was examined by a chromogenic assay. C5a inactivation was evaluated by C-terminal cleavage of C5a and inhibition of C5a-induced human neutrophil migration. Clot lysis time prolongation was examined by a tissue-type plasminogen activator-induced clot lysis assay.ResultsCPB2 activity in human plasma was increased by TM alfa and thrombin in a concentration-dependent manner. TM alfa inhibited tissue factor-induced thrombin generation and enhanced pro-CPB2 activation in human plasma simultaneously. The mass spectrum of C5a treated with TM alfa, thrombin, and pro-CPB2 was decreased at 156m/z, indicating that TM alfa enhanced the processing of C5a to C-terminal-cleaved C5a, an inactive form of C5a. C5a-induced human neutrophil migration was decreased after C5a treatment with TM alfa, thrombin, and pro-CPB2. TM alfa prolonged the clot lysis time in human plasma, and this effect was completely abolished by addition of a CPB2 inhibitor.ConclusionsTM alfa exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrinolytic effects through CPB2 in the presence of thrombin in vitro.",November 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Shunsuke', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Tawara'}, {'given-name': 'Takumi', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sakai'}, {'given-name': 'Osamu', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Matsuzaki'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384816305461,1-s2.0-S0049384816305461
Reduced In Vitro Clot Lysis and Release of More Active Platelet PAI-1 in Polycythemia Vera and Essential Thrombocythemia,"AbstractBecause platelets interact with fibrinolysis in a complex manner, it can be expected that with abnormal platelet numbers and quality this interference can be even more profound. The aim of this work was to study the lysis-resistance of platelet-rich clots in diseases with high platelet counts: polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and to make comparison with polyglobulia (PG). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) were analyzed by an in vitro clot lysis test. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity was measured in plasma and in the supernatants of the washed and gel-filtered platelets after activation by thrombin. The lysis showed decreased speed of PPP-clots in PV and ET. This phenomenon was even more marked in PRP-clots from PV and ET, but further increased lysis resistance after retraction was not observed in PV and ET, most likely due to abnormal platelet functions. Our results suggest that the fibrinolytic activity is reduced in PV and ET, and may play a role both in the increased aptitude for venous thrombosis and in the arterial complications. These are partly caused by higher plasmatic PAI-1 activity as well as by more active platelet PAI-1. The PAI-1 activity was significantly higher in the supernatants of the washed and gel-filtered platelets of PV after activation by thrombin compared with controls. Other factors might have influenced the reduced fibrinolysis.",15 April 1998,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Emőke', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Pósán'}, {'given-name': 'György', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ujj'}, {'given-name': 'Attila', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kiss'}, {'given-name': 'Béla', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Telek'}, {'given-name': 'Kálmán', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Rák'}, {'given-name': 'Miklós', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Udvardy'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004938489800005X,1-s2.0-S004938489800005X
IMPAIRED CLOT LYSIS BY rt-PA CATALYZED MINI-PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATION,"AbstractThe fibrinolytic system contains a proenzyme plasminogen (Plg) which is converted to plasmin (Plm) by the action of Plg activators. Physiological Plg activators are: tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator. Plg was shown to be further cleaved by leukocyte elastase producing several fragments, one of wich is called mini-plasminogen (mini-Plg) or neo-plasminogen Val442. In this paper we studied whether mini-Plg is able to produce clot lysis when it is activated by rt-PA in purified systems and in Plg depleted normal plasma. We found that mini-Plg clot lysis time was longer than that of Plg. Clot lysis times were 2.3 minutes ± 0.06 for Plg and 9.8 minutes ± 0.1 for mini-Plg. Mini-Plg is less efficient than Plg in producing clot lysis at all studied concentrations (0.1–1.2μM). In Plg depleted normal human plasma mini-Plg is unable to produce complete clot lysis in presence of rt-PA. Although mini-Plg can be activated to mini-Plm by rt-PA, these results show that the activation process is insufficient to produce an efficient clot lysis. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd",15 June 1997,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Cristina', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Duboscq'}, {'given-name': 'Valeria', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Genoud'}, {'given-name': 'M.Fernanda', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Parborell'}, {'given-name': 'Lucía C.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kordich'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384897000996,1-s2.0-S0049384897000996
"Influence of polymer architecture on antigens camouflage, CD47 protection and complement mediated lysis of surface grafted red blood cells","AbstractHyperbranched polyglycerol (HPG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers with similar hydrodynamic sizes in solution were grafted to red blood cells (RBCs) to investigate the impact of polymer architecture on the cell structure and function. The hydrodynamic sizes of polymers were calculated from the diffusion coefficients measured by pulsed field gradient NMR. The hydration of the HPG and PEG was determined by differential scanning calorimetry analyses. RBCs grafted with linear PEG had different properties compared to the compact HPG grafted RBCs. HPG grafted RBCs showed much higher electrophoretic mobility values than PEG grafted RBCs at similar grafting concentrations and hydrodynamic sizes indicating differences in the structure of the polymer exclusion layer on the cell surface. PEG grafting impacted the deformation properties of the membrane to a greater degree than HPG. The complement mediated lysis of the grafted RBCs was dependent on the type of polymer, grafting concentration and molecular size of grafted chains. At higher molecular weights and graft concentrations both HPG and PEG triggered complement activation. The magnitude of activation was higher with HPG possibly due to the presence of many hydroxyl groups per molecule. HPG grafted RBCs showed significantly higher levels of CD47 self-protein accessibility than PEG grafted RBCs at all grafting concentrations and molecular sizes. PEG grafted polymers provided, in general, a better shielding and protection to ABO and minor antigens from antibody recognition than HPG polymers, however, the compact HPGs provided greater protection of certain antigens on the RBC surface. Our data showed that HPG 20kDa and HPG 60kDa grafted RBCs exhibited properties that are more comparable to the native RBC than PEG 5kDa and PEG 10kDa grafted RBCs of comparable hydrodynamic sizes. The study shows that small compact polymers such as HPG 20kDa have a greater potential in the generation of functional RBC for therapeutic delivery applications.

Major mechanistic differences explain the higher clot lysis potency of reteplase over alteplase: lack of fibrin binding is an advantage for bolus application of fibrin-specific thrombolytics,"SummaryReteplase is a plasminogen activator composed of the kringle 2 and the protease domain of tissue-type plasminogen activator (alteplase). Two bolus injections of 10 U, 30 min apart, allow a more rapid and complete reperfusion of the occluded vessel than the accelerated infusion-regimen of alteplase. The longer half-life of reteplase is supposed to be a reason for the high in-vivo potency of the molecule. The standard in-vitro analysis revealed a lower plasmin-forming activity and a lack of high-affinity fibrin binding of reteplase compared to alteplase. In this paper, we determine the activity of reteplase and alteplase in a dynamic plasma clot lysis model. In contrast to other clot lysis activity assays, this model allows the pressure-driven plasma to flow through the clot, mimicking the in-vivo situation. At low concentrations, both reteplase and alteplase have a similar activity. At high concentrations, as achieved during the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, reteplase is more potent than alteplase. Immunostaining of plasma clots demonstrates that alteplase tightly binds to the fibrin matrix and accumulates at the surface of the clot. As a consequence, activation of plasminogen and the subsequent degradation of the fibrin matrix is supposed to occur from the surface to the interior of the clot, depending on the permanent supply of plasminogen from the plasma. In contrast, reteplase penetrates the clot due to its lack of fibrin binding which in turn allows the activation of plasminogen inside the clot. We discuss the ability of plasma clot penetration in relation to the achievement of a high in-vivo efficacy of fibrinspecific thrombolytic agents, especially when applied by bolus injection.",May 1997,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'S.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Fischer'}, {'given-name': 'U.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kohnert'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0268949997800574,1-s2.0-S0268949997800574
Histotripsy Thrombolysis on Retracted Clots,"AbstractRetracted blood clots have been previously recognized to be more resistant to drug-based thrombolysis methods, even with ultrasound and microbubble enhancements. Microtripsy, a new histotripsy approach, has been investigated as a non-invasive, drug-free and image-guided method that uses ultrasound to break up clots with improved treatment accuracy and a lower risk of vessel damage compared with the traditional histotripsy thrombolysis approach. Unlike drug-mediated thrombolysis, which is dependent on the permeation of the thrombolytic agents into the clot, microtripsy controls acoustic cavitation to fractionate clots. We hypothesize that microtripsy thrombolysis is effective on retracted clots and that the treatment efficacy can be enhanced using strategies incorporating electronic focal steering. To test our hypothesis, retracted clots were prepared in vitro and the mechanical properties were quantitatively characterized. Microtripsy thrombolysis was applied on the retracted clots in an in vitro flow model using three different strategies: single-focus, electronically-steered multi-focus and dual-pass multi-focus. Results show that microtripsy was used to successfully generate a flow channel through the retracted clot and the flow was restored. The multi-focus and the dual-pass treatments incorporating the electronic focal steering significantly increased the recanalized flow channel size compared to the single-focus treatments. The dual-pass treatments achieved a restored flow rate up to 324 mL/min without cavitation contacting the vessel wall. The clot debris particles generated from microtripsy thrombolysis remained within the safe range. The results of this study show the potential of microtripsy thrombolysis for retracted clot recanalization with the enhancement of electronic focal steering.",August 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Xi', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Zhang'}, {'given-name': 'Gabe E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Owens'}, {'given-name': 'Charles A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Cain'}, {'given-name': 'Hitinder S.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Gurm'}, {'given-name': 'Jonathan', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Macoskey'}, {'given-name': 'Zhen', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Xu'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301562916300035,1-s2.0-S0301562916300035
Proteins behaving badly. Substoichiometric molecular control and amplification of the initiation and nature of amyloid fibril formation: lessons from and for blood clotting,"AbstractThe chief and largely terminal element of normal blood clotting is considered to involve the polymerisation of the mainly α-helical fibrinogen to fibrin, with a binding mechanism involving ‘knobs and holes’ but with otherwise little change in protein secondary structure. We recognise, however, that extremely unusual mutations or mechanical stressing can cause fibrinogen to adopt a conformation containing extensive β-sheets. Similarly, prions can change morphology from a largely α-helical to largely β-sheet conformation, and the latter catalyses both the transition and the self-organising polymerisation of the β-sheet structures. Many other proteins can also do this, where it is known as amyloidogenesis. When fibrin is formed in samples from patients harbouring different diseases it can have widely varying diameters and morphologies. We here develop the idea, and summarise the evidence, that in many cases the anomalous fibrin fibre formation seen in such diseases actually amounts to amyloidogenesis. In particular, fibrin can interact with the amyloid-β (Aβ) protein that is misfolded in Alzheimer's disease. Seeing these unusual fibrin morphologies as true amyloids explains a great deal about fibrin(ogen) biology that was previously opaque, and provides novel strategies for treating such coagulopathies. The literature on blood clotting can usefully both inform and be informed by that on prions and on the many other widely recognised (β-)amyloid proteins. A preprint has been lodged in bioRxiv (Kell and Pretorius, 2016).",Available online 21 August 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Douglas B.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kell'}, {'given-name': 'Etheresia', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Pretorius'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0079610716300499,1-s2.0-S0079610716300499
DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF LYS- AND MINI-PLASMINOGEN ON CLOT LYSIS INDUCED BY RECOMBINANT UROKINASE AND RECOMBINANT PRO-UROKINASE IN A CANINE THROMBOSIS MODEL,"AbstractThese studies were conducted to examine the lytic efficacy of recombinant urokinase (r-UK) and pro-urokinase (r-proUK) in the presence and absence of truncated forms of plasminogen. Due to differences in their structures, these modified proteins are more readily activated to plasmin than the circulating form of plasminogen. Use of such modified substrates for plasminogen activators may improve the clinical outcome in patients treated for a variety of thrombotic diseases. Lys-plasminogen (46 units) or mini-plasminogen (in units of equivalent chromogenic activity), in conjunction with r-UK (7,500 units), were administered in the absence of heparin to dogs (9 – 11 kg) in which a radiolabelled thrombus was formed in a femoral artery. Fibrinolysis was measured as a loss of radioactivity from the clot. After intra-arterial administration of the agents, clot lysis was 48 ± 8%, 50 ± 9% and 75 ± 2% in the presence of r-UK + vehicle, r-UK + lys-plasminogen, and r-UK + mini-plasminogen, respectively. When these treatment groups were examined in the presence of heparin (500 units + 350 units/hour) in a second study, r-UK (2,000 units) produced clot lysis of 54 ± 35; addition of lys- or mini-plasminogen to the regimen resulted in lysis of 62 ± 9% and 46 ± 10%, respectively. A third phase of the study examined r-proUK (1,000 units) with heparin; in this case, lysis was 51 ± 9% in the presence of vehicle, but 55 ± 17% and 10 ± 5% when lys- and mini-plasminogen were administered, respectively. Flow restoration, measured in the femoral artery in each experiment, generally paralleled the lytic profile. The results indicate that supplementation with mini-plasminogen is only useful when added to a lytic regimen in the absence of heparin, and that lys-plasminogen, in conjunction with either of the lytic agents, does not improve clot lysis in this canine model.",15 September 1996,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Sandra E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Burke'}, {'given-name': 'Don J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Davidson'}, {'given-name': 'Nathan L.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Lubbers'}, {'given-name': 'Irene M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Reininger'}, {'given-name': 'Jack', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Henkin'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0049384896001521,1-s2.0-0049384896001521
In vitro plasma and euglobulin clot lysis in subjects with elevated lipoprotein(a),"SummaryLipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]is assumed to have a prothrombotic role by interfering with the physiological functions of plasminogen due to their structural similarities. In order to establish if elevated plasma Lp(a) levels affect in vitro clot lysis, 12 subjects with elevated Lp(a) (320–1650 mg/L) and 12 subjects with normal Lp(a) (&lt;100–141 mg/L) were studied. Groups were similar regarding age, gender, levels of other lipids and fibrinolytic variables. Spontaneous lysis and lysis induced by recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) of preformed 125I-fibrin labelled, mechanically non-compressed (‘non-retracted’) plasma clots, mechanically compressed (‘retracted’) plasma clots and euglobulin clots was measured. ‘Non-retracted’ and ‘retracted’ plasma clots lysed spontaneously in 48h on average by 15 to 16% and by 3% respectively in both groups. In subjects with elevated Lp(a) ‘non-retracted’ plasma clots lysed with rt-PA (final conc. 50 and 100 ng/mL) in 4h on average by 34±4% and 58±6%, which was not significantly different from 38±7% and 55±8% clot lysis in subjects with normal Lp(a). ‘Retracted’ plasma clot lysed with 200 ng/mL rt-PA in 4h on average by 32±5% in subjects with elevated Lp(a) and by 35±6% in subjects with normal Lp(a) (not significant, all values mean±SD). In subjects with elevated Lp(a), Lp(a) had no effect on rt-PA induced lysis of ‘retracted’ plasma clots incubated in the subject's own plasma. Spontaneous and rt-PA induced euglobulin clot lysis was not significantly different between the two groups studied.

Thrombin generation and fibrin clot formation under hypothermic conditions: An in vitro evaluation of tissue factor initiated whole blood coagulation,"AbstractBackgroundDespite trauma-induced hypothermic coagulopathy being familiar in the clinical setting, empirical experimentation concerning this phenomenon is lacking. In this study, we investigated the effects of hypothermia on thrombin generation, clot formation, and global hemostatic functions in an in vitro environment using a whole blood model and thromboelastography, which can recapitulate hypothermia.MethodsBlood was collected from healthy individuals through venipuncture and treated with corn trypsin inhibitor, to block the contact pathway. Coagulation was initiated with 5pM tissue factor at temperatures 37°C, 32°C, and 27°C. Reactions were quenched over time, with soluble and insoluble components analyzed for thrombin generation, fibrinogen consumption, factor (f)XIII activation, and fibrin deposition. Global coagulation potential was evaluated through thromboelastography.ResultsData showed that thrombin generation in samples at 37°C and 32°C had comparable rates, whereas 27°C had a much lower rate (39.2 ± 1.1 and 43 ± 2.4 nM/min vs 28.6 ± 4.4 nM/min, respectively). Fibrinogen consumption and fXIII activation were highest at 37°C, followed by 32°C and 27°C. Fibrin formation as seen through clot weights also followed this trend. Thromboelastography data showed that clot formation was fastest in samples at 37°C and lowest at 27°C. Maximum clot strength was similar for each temperature. Also, percent lysis of clots was highest at 37°C followed by 32°C and then 27°C.ConclusionsInduced hypothermic conditions directly affect the rate of thrombin generation and clot formation, whereas global clot stability remains intact.",February 2014,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Matthew F.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Whelihan'}, {'given-name': 'Armin', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kiankhooy'}, {'given-name': 'Kathleen E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Brummel-Ziedins'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0883944113003900,1-s2.0-S0883944113003900

A combination of recombinant single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator and streptokinase has a synergistic non-fibrin specific action on in vitro clot lysis,"SummaryThrombolytic effects of streptokinase (SK), a recombinant single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (rscu-PA), and their combinations were measured in an in vitro system composed of 125I-fibrin labelled human plasma clot immersed in a citrated human plasma at 37°C. Clot lysis was monitored by release of 125I-fibrin degradation products and an activation of the fibrinolytic system in the surrounding plasma was measured by fibrinogen, plasminogen and α2-antiplasmin levels.SK and rscu-PA induced dose- and time-dependent clot lysis: 50% lysis in 4h was obtained with 75 nM SK and 38nM rscu-PA, respectively. At these concentrations, no significant activation of the fibrinolytic system in plasma was observed with rscu-PA, whereas SK produced fibrinogen breakdown. As was judged by a mathematical analysis of dose-response curves by the isobole method, simultaneous and sequential equimolar combinations of SK and rscu-PA caused a significant non-fibrin specific synergistic thrombolytic effect. The synergy of thrombolytic action of these combinations persisted for 24h and was more pronounced at the subsequent addition of SK followed by rscu-PA (in 1h). 4h after the addition of 25 nM of SK or rscu-PA, they had induced 6% and 25% lysis respectively, while simultaneous or sequential addition of both plasminogen activators at the same concentrations induced 55% and 80% clot lysis. The maximal achievable 5-fold increase in the thrombolytic action of sequential combinations was observed in the molar ratio of plasminogen activators 1:1, as compared with the total effect of the agents at the same concentrations as used in simultaneous combinations. The synergistic thrombolytic effect of the sequential equimolar combinations was more fibrin-specific than that of the simultaneous combinations.It is concluded that the simultaneous and sequential equimolar combinations of SK and rscu-PA possessed synergistic thrombolytic action on clot lysis in vitro. The sequential combination of equimolar concentrations of these plasminogen activators induced a moderate activation of the fibrinolytic system while the simultaneous combination produced a significant exhaustion of the fibrinolytic system.",November 1995,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'G.V.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bashkov'}, {'given-name': 'J.V.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Jitkova'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0268949995800832,1-s2.0-S0268949995800832
Fibrin clot structure is affected by levels of particulate air pollution exposure in patients with venous thrombosis,"AbstractBackgroundParticulate air pollution is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and thrombosis. Long-term exposure to particulate matter with a diameter&lt;10μm (PM10) has been associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis.ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to investigate whether or not particulate air pollution alters fibrin clot structure and thus modulates thrombosis risk.MethodsWe investigated fibrin polymerization by turbidity (maximum absorbance mOD), clot structure by confocal microscopy (fibre number per μm) and fibrin pore size by permeability (Ks×10−10cm2) in 103 patients with deep vein thrombosis and 121 healthy controls, for whom levels of air pollution exposure had been recorded. Exposure groups were defined by mean PM10 concentrations over the 730days before the event.ResultsWe found a higher average number of fibres per clot area in patients than controls, but no difference in Ks or fibre thickness. When the two groups were divided into high or low exposure to PM10, a significantly denser fibrin clot network structure with thicker fibres (higher maximum absorbance, p&lt;0.05), decreased permeability (lower Ks value, p&lt;0.05) and higher average fibre numbers per clot area (p&lt;0.05) was observed in patients in the high exposure group compared to those with low exposure. There were no significant differences in fibrin clot structure between the two exposure levels in healthy subjects.ConclusionsPM10 levels are associated with altered fibrin clot structure in patients with deep vein thrombosis but not in controls, suggesting that air pollution may trigger differences in fibrin clot structure only in patients predisposed to thrombotic disease.",July–August 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Xiaoxi', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Pan'}, {'given-name': 'Yun Yun', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Gong'}, {'given-name': 'Ida', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Martinelli'}, {'given-name': 'Laura', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Angelici'}, {'given-name': 'Chiara', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Favero'}, {'given-name': 'Pier Alberto', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bertazzi'}, {'given-name': 'Pier M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Mannucci'}, {'given-name': 'Robert A.S.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ariëns'}, {'given-name': 'Michael N.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Routledge'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160412016301106,1-s2.0-S0160412016301106

"Relationships between protein C, protein S, von Willebrand factor and euglobulin lysis time and cardiovascular risk factors in subjects with and without coronary heart disease","AbstractMeasures of fibrinolytic and thrombotic function have been examined in 55 subjects with recently identified coronary heart disease, and age and sex matched control subjects. Measurements were particularly directed at factors and processes which could be affected by changes in endothelial function and included the euglobulin lysis time as well as plasma levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF). Plasma levels of protein S and protein C were also measured. Measurements were made before and after a period of 10-min veno-occlusion combined with rhythmic hand exercise. In addition anthropometric, haemodynamic and biochemical measurements (plasma lipids and apolipoproteins, glucose and insulin) were obtained and correlated with the haematological parameters. Protein S and vWF levels were significantly higher, both before and after veno-occlusive exercise, in subjects with CHD than in the asymptomatic controls. Euglobulin lysis times were not significantly different but only shortened on veno-occlusive exercise in those without CHD. Protein S levels were significantly correlated with systolic blood pressure, plasma total cholesterol, plasma triglyceride, plasma phospholipid, plasma fasting glucose and both apolipoprotein A1 and B levels. vWF levels were not significantly related to any of the other variables. Subjects whose pre-exercise euglobulin lysis times exceeded 6 h had significantly higher BMI, plasma total cholesterol, triglyceride, phospholipid, insulin, glucose and apoB concentrations and lower HDL cholesterol than those with lysis in less than 6 h. The findings from this study are consistent with a role for endothelial dysfunction in the production of atherosclerotic vascular disease and may indicate additional, non-haemodynamic, mechanisms for such an association. In addition, the relationship between elevated levels of protein S and CHD does not appear to depend on the demonstrated associations between protein S and a number of other cardiovascular risk factors.",September 1998,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Anthony M', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Dart'}, {'given-name': 'Bridget', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Cooper'}, {'given-name': 'Sally B', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kay'}, {'given-name': 'Hatem', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Salem'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021915098001099,1-s2.0-S0021915098001099

"Differences in clot lysis among patients demonstrated in vitro with three thrombolytic agents (tissue-type plasminogen activator, streptokinase and urokinase)","AbstractThis study compares the ability of 3 thrombolytic drugs to promote clot lysis using a new in vitro testing procedure. Whole blood samples from 132 patients were tested using 5 different concentrations of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), streptokinase (SK) and urokinase. A mixture of blood and thrombolytic drug was placed on a dryreagent test card containing reptilase, buffers and paramagnetic particles where clot formation occurred. Analysis of the motion of the clot-embedded paramagnetic particles caused by an oscillating magnetic field was used to define the lysis onset time. The slope of the linear regression plot of lysis onset time versus 1/[drug concentration] defined the kinetic rate constant (k) for each drug in each patient. Higher values of k indicated greater resistance to in vitro clot lysis. In the patients studied, there was a large range of k values for t-PA and SK (coefficient of variation 143 and 137%, respectively) but a smaller range of k for urokinase (coefficient of variation 32%). The coefficients of variation for t-PA and SK observed in the study group were five- to 10-fold greater than the coefficients of variation determined for replicate test measurements. Resistance to all SK concentrations tested was found in 9% of the patients. In vitro sensitivity to thrombolysis was compared among the drugs by correlating the derived k values. These comparisons indicated no relation for any of the drugs; many patients had a relatively low k value for 1 drug, while having a relatively high k value for a different drug. Preliminary results in 6 patients with acute myocardial infarction tested prospectively with a clinical version of this system identified 1 patient in whom there likely was a failure of the thrombolytic drug. These data suggest that in vitro testing before the administration of a thrombolytic drug is feasible and may be clinically useful in determining the drug choice for an individual patient.",15 March 1994,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'David R.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Musselman'}, {'given-name': 'David A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Tate'}, {'given-name': 'Bruce J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Oberhardt'}, {'given-name': 'Anthony F.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Abruzzini'}, {'given-name': 'Mary Beth', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Blauwet'}, {'given-name': 'Gary', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Koch'}, {'given-name': 'Gregory J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Dehmer'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0002914994903301,1-s2.0-0002914994903301

"Making the right choice: Optimizing rt-PA and eptifibatide lysis, an in vitro study","AbstractIntroductionRecombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is the only FDA approved lytic therapy for acute ischemic stroke. However, there can be complications such as intra-cerebral hemorrhage. This has led to interest in adjuncts such as GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors. However, there is little data on combined therapies. Here, we measure clot lysis for rt-PA and eptifibatide in an in vitro human clot model, and determine the drug concentrations maximizing lysis. A pharmacokinetic model is used to compare drug concentrations expected in clinical trials with those used here. The hypothesis is that there is a range of rt-PA and eptifibatide concentrations that maximize in vitro clot lysis.Materials and MethodsWhole blood clots were made from blood obtained from 28 volunteers, after appropriate institutional approval. Sample clots were exposed to rt-PA and eptifibatide in human fresh-frozen plasma; rt-PA concentrations were 0, 0.5, 1, and 3.15μg/ml, and eptifibatide concentrations were 0, 0.63, 1.05, 1.26 and 2.31μg/ml. All exposures were for 30minutes at 37C. Clot width was measured using a microscopic imaging technique and mean fractional clot loss (FCL) at 30minutes was used to determine lytic efficacy. On average, 28 clots (range: 6-148) from 6 subjects (3-24) were used in each group.Results and ConclusionsFCL for control clots was 14% (95% Confidence Interval: 13-15%).

Here, FCL was 43% (36-51) and 35% (32-38) respectively.

“Plasminogen steal” and clot lysis,"AbstractAlthough initially developed to reduce the risk of bleeding, second-generation (clot-selective) thrombolytic agents have been found to induce more prompt and frequent recanalizatton than do nonselective, first-generation agents. To determine whether they do so in part by preserving clot-associated plasminogen, human whole blood clots formed in Chandler tubes were studied. Addition of suprapharmacologic concentrations of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) to the media bathing mature clots led to a paradoxic impairment of clot lysis and a concomitant concentration-dependent depletion of clot-associated plasminogen (Western blot analysis). In contrast, supplementation of the plasma with plasminogen (0.27 mg/ml) led to significant conservation of both plasma and clot-associated plasminogen (p ≤ 0.05, n = 4), and prevented the diminution of clot lysis (p ≤ 0.05; n = 4).Fibrinogen degradation products did not account for the attenuation of lysis with the highest concentrations of rt-PA. In concentrations equivalent to those that were induced by the highest concentrations of rt-PA evaluated, fibrinogen degradation products potentiated rather than inhibited lysis (p ≤ 0.05, n = 4), probably by stimulating rt-PA activity directly. When preformed clots were incubated with plasminogen-depleted plasma plus 1,000 ng/ml rt-PA, the plasminogen content in residual clot declined (9.36 ± 0.46 versus 12.39 ± 0.69 ng/mg clot found in nondepleted plasma; p ≤ 0.05; n = 6). Furthermore, clot lysis was attenuated completely.Thus, clot lysis induced by activation of plasminogen is dependent on clot-associated plasminogen, which in turn depends on the concentration of plasminogen in plasma. Depletion of both is likely to contribute to the lower frequency and rapidity of coronary recanalization induced with nonclot-selective compared with selective fibrinolytic agents because of the depletion of plasma plasminogen and the plasminogen steal they characteristically induce.",April 1992,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Sheryl R.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Torr'}, {'given-name': 'Denise A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Nachowiak'}, {'given-name': 'Satoshi', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Fujii'}, {'given-name': 'Burton E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sobel'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/073510979290300C,1-s2.0-073510979290300C
Control of clot lysis by gene transfer,"AbstractIntravascular clot formation is a local process that can result in serious clinical consequences, including limb loss and death. Gene transfer and expression of recombinant plasminogen activators in the endothelial cells of the vessel wall offer an attractive approach to the enhancement of local fibrinolytic activity. In vitro studies have demonstrated that endothelial cell fibrinolytic activity can be increased by gene transfer of either secreted or cell surface-anchored plasminogen activators.

Ultrasound active nanoscaled lipid formulations for thrombus lysis,"AbstractIn the present study, we investigated the sonothrombolytic effect of new nanoscaled lipid formulations in human blood clots, using diagnostic ultrasound. Human blood clots of 1ml were incubated with 1μl of the different lipid dispersions DPPC/CH, DPPC/PEG40S, DSPC/PEG40S and the commercially available ultrasound contrast agent SonoVue®. Clots were stored for 3days at 5°C to obtain maximal clot retraction and lytic resistance. Each clot weight was determined before and after continuous insonation for 1h of insonation at 1.4MHz. The pressure in the insonation chamber was 80mm Hg to mimic middle arterial blood pressure. There were no significant differences in thrombus weight before insonation. All nanoscaled formulations and SonoVue® were able to reduce thrombus weight compared to the weight loss of clots that were not insonated but kept under pressure for one hour (p&lt;0.001). We found a highly significant weight reduction with DSPC/PEG40S compared to SonoVue® (p=0.007).Nanoscaled DSPC/PEG40S dispersion could be a promising formulation in ultrasound enhanced thrombolysis even without thrombolytic drugs. Stable cavitation is a crucial parameter in fragmentation of thrombus architecture. Further studies of physicochemical properties of DSPC/PEG40S are necessary to corroborate our hypothesis.",April 2011,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Andreas', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Becker'}, {'given-name': 'Elena', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Marxer'}, {'given-name': 'Jana', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Brüßler'}, {'given-name': 'Anne Sophia', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Hoormann'}, {'given-name': 'Daniela', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kuhnt'}, {'given-name': 'Udo', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bakowsky'}, {'given-name': 'Christopher', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Nimsky'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0939641110003218,1-s2.0-S0939641110003218

Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Central Retinal Artery Occlusion Results of a Prospective and Standardized Medical Examination,"PurposeTo analyze the underlying risk factors in patients with nonarteritic central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) in a well-defined and homogenous group of patients enrolled in the European Assessment Group for Lysis in the Eye (EAGLE) study.DesignAnalysis of the cardiovascular risk factors in a prospective, randomized clinical trial.ParticipantsSeventy-seven EAGLE patients with nonarteritic CRAO.MethodsAnalysis of vascular risk factors and underlying diseases detected by questionnaire and standardized physical examination within 1 month after occlusion.Main Outcome MeasuresThe standardized physical examination included carotid Doppler ultrasonography, echocardiography, electrocardiography, blood pressure monitoring, pulse rate, urine analysis, body mass index analysis, and laboratory tests.ResultsSeventy-seven of 84 patients had complete datasets for analysis. Fifty-two (67%) patients had cardiovascular risk factors in their medical history, and comprehensive phenotyping identified at least 1 new risk factor in 60 patients (78%; 95% confidence interval, 67%–87%). Thirty-one (40%) had carotid artery stenosis of at least 70%. Eleven patients experienced a stroke, 5 of those within 4 weeks after the CRAO occurred. Arterial hypertension was found in 56 (73%) patients and was newly diagnosed in 12 (16%) study participants. Cardiac diseases were also highly prevalent (22% coronary artery disease, 20% atrial fibrillation, and 17% valvular heart disease).ConclusionsPreviously undiagnosed vascular risk factors were found in 78% of all CRAO patients.

Prolonged bleeding time as a marker of venous clot lysis during streptokinase therapy,"AbstractDespite their expense and inconvenience, serial ultrasound or venographic examinations are currently the only available methods to assess the efficacy of thrombolysis for deep venous thrombosis (DVT). We therefore tested whether the bleeding time (BT), a simple and inexpensive test, is useful in assessing lytic efficacy and might thus be a valuable adjunct in guiding the dose and duration of the thrombolytic agent. Serial BTs were obtained dally in 16 patients (eight men and eight women, average age 45.5 years, range 19 to 70) receiving streptokinase (SK) for proximal lower extremity DVT (n = 5), for upper extremity DVT (n = 10), or for renal vein thrombosis (n = 1). Duration of treatment averaged 89.9 ± 43.6 hours (range 35 to 198 hours). Clot lysis on ultrasound, venogram, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was defined as: complete (≥90%), moderate (50% to 90%), minimal (&lt;50%), or none. Important (complete or moderate) clot lysis occurred in 9 of 15 patients for whom follow-up studies were available. BT prolongation was defined as greater than 9.5 minutes and, during SK therapy, had a sensitivity of 0.67 and a specificity of 0.67 for important clot lysis. The positive predictive value of prolonged BT for clot lysis was 0.75. Calculated likelihood ratios revealed that a patient with BT prolongation was twice as likely to have important clot lysis rather than minimal or no lysis. These findings suggest that the BT should undergo further investigation as a simple, adjunctive, noninvasive marker of thrombolytic efficacy among DVT patients treated with SK.",October 1991,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Denise R.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Hirsch'}, {'given-name': 'Steven E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Reis'}, {'given-name': 'Joseph F.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Polak'}, {'given-name': 'Barbara Conway', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Donovan'}, {'given-name': 'Samuel Z.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Goldhaber'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/000287039190459U,1-s2.0-000287039190459U
The thrombolytic potency of LMW-heparin compared to urokinase in a rabbit jugular vein clot lysis model,"AbstractSince the beginning of the clinical use of low molecular weight (LMW) heparins their thrombolytic or profibrinolytic potency has been a matter of controversial discussions. Regarding this problem, the aim of our study was to test a LMW-heparin (Sandoparin) in an in vivo model comparing its lytic activity to unfractionated heparin and urokinase at different doses. For this purpose a newly developed short-term rabbit jugular vein clot lysis model was developed. Urokinase infused at doses of 3300, 6600 and 10,000 U/kg to control animals for one hour showed a clear dose-dependent clot lysis. Test animals were injected with a bolus of 0.5 mg/kg of LMW-heparin followed by a constant infusion of either 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg for one hour. A similar dose-dependent effect was observed for LMW-heparin as for urokinase. Unfractionated heparin did not exhibit a dose-dependent lytic activity in this model. No lysis was found in rabbits treated with saline. These findings suggest that the LMW-heparin tested exhibits a dose-dependent in vivo lytic activity which can be compared to clinically effective doses of urokinase, and that this activity is not present with unfractionated heparin.",1 May 1992,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'P.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bacher'}, {'given-name': 'D.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Welzel'}, {'given-name': 'O.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Iqbal'}, {'given-name': 'D.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Hoppensteadt'}, {'given-name': 'D.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Callas'}, {'given-name': 'J.M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Walenga'}, {'given-name': 'J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Fareed'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004938489290185D,1-s2.0-004938489290185D

Lipoprotein(a) enhances plasma clot lysis in vitro,"AbstractHuman plasma lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is a macromolecular complex that contains a protein homologous to plasminogen, the precursor of plasmin. We confirmed recent reports that Lp(a) is not activated by streptokinase or tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) to yield plasmin-like activity. In testing the hypothesis that Lp(a) can competitively inhibit plasma clot lysis mediated by plasmin, the present study shows that Lp(a) significantly enhanced plasma clot lysis mediated by streptokinase or t-PA. The enhancement, however, was not observed in a plasmin-mediated clot lysis using a purified fibrinogen system. The addition of α-2-antiplasmin (α2-plasmin inhibitor) to this system inhibited fibrinolysis; however, no inhibition was observed in the presence of Lp(a). One potential explanation for the Lp(a)-enhanced plasma clot lysis is that Lp(a) neutralizes the activity of α2-antiplasmin present in plasma, thereby restoring the activity of plasmin to lyse the clot.",2 July 1990,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Simon J.T.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Mao'}, {'given-name': 'Michelle A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Tucci'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0014579390803064,1-s2.0-0014579390803064
Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 in platelets induces thrombogenicity by increasing thrombolysis resistance under shear stress in an in-vitro flow chamber model,"AbstractIntroductionDespite the proven benefits of thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) for peripheral thromboembolism, perfusion failure frequently occurs, particularly in arterial circulation. We evaluated how the modification of fibrinolytic activity affects thrombus formation under flow and static conditions.Materials and methodst-PA-treated human whole-blood samples (n=6) were perfused over a microchip coated with collagen and tissue thromboplastin at different shear rates, and thrombus formation was quantified by measuring flow pressure changes. For comparison, rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) was used to evaluate fibrinolytic activity under static conditions.ResultsAt a shear rate of 240s−1, t-PA (200–800IU/ml) concentration-dependently delayed capillary occlusion, whereas at 600s−1, capillary occlusion was significantly faster and t-PA had limited effects, even at a supra-pharmacological concentration (800IU/ml). In contrast, 200IU/ml t-PA efficiently prevented clot formation in the ROTEM assay. The combined treatment of blood with a specific PAI-1 inhibitor (PAI-039) moderately enhanced the efficacy of t-PA, but only under flow conditions. In addition, 1:1-diluted blood samples of PAI-1-deficient (−/−) mice showed a significant delay of capillary occlusion at 240s−1, compared with those from wild-type mice (1.55 fold; P&lt;0.001). This delayed occlusion was reproduced in samples containing platelets from PAI-1−/− and plasma from wild type, but was not observed by the opposite combination of blood components.ConclusionsThe present results suggest that the anti-thrombotic efficacy of t-PA is sensitive to arterial shear flow, and that PAI-1 secreted from activated platelets plays an essential role in thrombolytic resistance.",October 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Kazuya', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Hosokawa'}, {'given-name': 'Tomoko', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ohnishi-Wada'}, {'given-name': 'Hisayo', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sameshima-Kaneko'}, {'given-name': 'Tomoka', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Nagasato'}, {'given-name': 'Naoki', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Miura'}, {'given-name': 'Kiyoshi', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kikuchi'}, {'given-name': 'Takehiko', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Koide'}, {'given-name': 'Ikuro', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Maruyama'}, {'given-name': 'Tetsumei', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Urano'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384816305370,1-s2.0-S0049384816305370
Contribution of neutrophil elastase to the lysis of obliterative thrombi in the context of their platelet and fibrin content,"AbstractLeukocytes invade newly formed thrombi through interactions with platelets and fibrin and later contribute to the removal of fibrin deposits mainly through the action of neutrophil elastase. The present study attempts to express in quantitative terms the impact of neutrophils on the lytic processes in obliterative thrombi based on the local presence of elastase-specific fibrin degradation products (NE-FDP) in relation to the leukocyte, platelet and fibrin content of thrombi. Immunofluorescent detection of fibrin, NE-FDP and platelet antigens was performed in sections of thrombi from 28 patients subjected to thrombectomy in combination with DNA-staining for identification of nucleated cells. The digitalized fluorescent microscopic images were decomposed according to the color channel of each thrombus constituent. The integrated intensity values for all thrombus constituents were statistically evaluated with correlation, hierarchical agglomerative clustering , Hotelling'sT2 and F-statistics. Association between NE-FDP and leukocyte content of thrombi is evidenced by a significant Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.71 (p=0.00002). Cluster analysis reveals two classes of thrombi according to NE-FDP, leukocyte and platelet content and also two according to NE-FDP, leukocyte and fibrin content. When NE-FDP, fibrin and platelet content is normalized to the leukocyte count in the same thrombus, clusters with platelet-related thrombolytic resistance (inversely related NE-FDP and platelet content) and advanced cell-dependent thrombolysis (inversely related NE-FDP and fibrin content) are identified. These distinct patterns of thrombus constituents are snapshots of characteristic stages in the cell-dependent thrombolysis, which indicate a clot-stabilizing role for platelets in this process similar to their impact on the plasmin-dependent lysis.",August 2010,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Gyöngyi', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Rábai'}, {'given-name': 'Nóra', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Szilágyi'}, {'given-name': 'Péter', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sótonyi'}, {'given-name': 'Ilona', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kovalszky'}, {'given-name': 'László', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Szabó'}, {'given-name': 'Raymund', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Machovich'}, {'given-name': 'Krasimir', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kolev'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384810002902,1-s2.0-S0049384810002902

Echinococcus granulosus: the mechanism of oncosphere lysis by sheep complement and antibody,"AbstractA heat-labile component of normal sheep serum (56°C for 30 min but not 50°C for 30 min) was able to lyse oncospheres in vitro. The degree of effect, and the proportion of oncospheres lysed, was related to the concentration of normal unheated sheep serum complement, or other sources of complement (rabbit, mouse) in the culture. Lower concentrations were required for lysis if the culture serum was obtained from sheep immune to E. granulosus infection. Heat inactivation of normal or immune sheep serum removed any lytic ability. No lysis occurred in any concentration of unheated foetal lamb serum. However, unheated foetal lamb serum was able to restore the lytic effect to heated normal or immune serum. This suggests that lysis in both immune and normal serum is antibody-dependent and complement-mediated. The lysis in normal serum would appear to be due to natural cross-reacting antibodies that can fix complement at the oncosphere surface. The complement lesion resulted in damage to the plasma membrane. This then peeled back, predisposing the oncosphere to osmotic destruction. The use of bleach to dissolve the embryophore caused damage to the plasma membrane similar to that caused by complement. Developing metacestodes at 3 days of age in vitro in immune serum were susceptible to the addition of complement at that time.",November 1994,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'D.D.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Heath'}, {'given-name': 'B.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Holcman'}, {'given-name': 'R.J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Shaw'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0020751994901562,1-s2.0-0020751994901562

The potency of tissue-type plasminogen activator (TPA) determined with chromogen and clot-lysis assays,"AbstractA assessment was made of two methods for determining the potency of tissue-type plasminogen activator (TPA). A chromogenic microtitre plate assay was established which contained TPA, plasminogen, a synthetic plasmin substrate (H-D-valyl-L-leucyl-L-lysyl-p-nitroaniline dihydrochloride, S2251) and any one of the following stimulators: native fibrinogen, enzymatic and chemical digests of fibrinogen, poly-D-lysine (PDL) and chemical derivatives of the latter. The chromogen assay was compared with an automated clot-lysis (turbidimetric) assay for sensitivity, reproducibility and validity for potency determination. Reference preparations of TPA were titrated in both assays: in the chromogen assay the dose-response curves were non-parallel, whereas parallelism was observed in the clot-lysis assay. Thus, the chromogen assay was restricted in its applicability and disqualified from any routine regulatory use. The potency of individual lots of recombinant (r)TPA could only be estimated in International Units (IU) of TPA activity with the automated clot-lysis assay and the potency values obtained (IU/vial) were in remarkably close agreement with the manufacturers' values.",April 1990,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Christodoulides'}, {'given-name': 'D.W.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Boucher'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/104510569090019V,1-s2.0-104510569090019V
Clot structure and fibrinolytic potential in patients with post thrombotic syndrome,"AbstractIntroductionPost-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a chronic sequel of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The clot structure and fibrinolytic potential in PTS is currently unknown.ObjectiveTo assess the fibrinolytic potential and clot structure in patients with PTS.Materials and methodsPatients with a history of DVT were included in a case–control study: patients with PTS (cases n=30) and without PTS (controls n=30), and 30 apparently healthy individuals (HI) without venous thromboembolism (VTE) or venous insufficiency were enrolled. Fibrinolysis and clot structure were assessed by turbidimetric assays, permeation, and confocal microscopy. Fibrinogen was measured by Clauss and fibrinogen γ′ by ELISA.ResultsWe observed a significant trend of decreasing maximum turbidity from HI (median 0.52 [IQR 0.46–0.62]), to controls (0.49 [IQR 0.41–0.55]), to cases (0.46 [IQR 0.39–0.49]) p=0.020. Fibrinogen was lower in patients (cases and controls) (3.69g/L [IQR 3.31–4.26]) compared to HI (4.17 [IQR 3.69–4.65]) p=0.041. Patients with recurrent VTE had lower maximum turbidity and lower permeation than patients with one episode of VTE; (0.31 [IQR 0.25–0.39] versus 0.38 [IQR 0.34–0.44] p=0.008) and (6.0×10−9/cm2 [IQR 5.1–7.9] versus 7.7×10−9/cm2 [IQR 6.0–10.0] p=0.047) respectively, at equal fibrinogen levels. There were no differences in lysis time, confocal microscopy, or fibrinogen γ′.ConclusionsLower maximum turbidity, indicating a tendency towards thinner fibres and denser clots, was found in patients with PTS as well as in patients with recurrent VTE. Fibrinogen levels did not explain these differences in clot structure. The abnormal clot structure may contribute to the increased thrombotic risk profile in patients with PTS.",January 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'A.C.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bouman'}, {'given-name': 'H.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'McPherson'}, {'given-name': 'Y.W.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Cheung'}, {'given-name': 'M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'ten Wolde'}, {'given-name': 'H.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'ten Cate'}, {'given-name': 'R.A.S.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ariëns'}, {'given-name': 'A.J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'ten Cate-Hoek'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384815301894,1-s2.0-S0049384815301894
