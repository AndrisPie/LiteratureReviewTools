The Occurrence of Thrombosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Is Reflected in the Clot Lysis Profile.,"The occurrence of thromboembolic events (TE) is an important extraintestinal manifestation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of this study was to compare fibrinolysis and clot lysis parameters between (1) patients with IBD and healthy controls and (2) patients with IBD with TE (IBD + TE) and without TE (IBD - TE). One hundred thirteen healthy controls and 202 patients with IBD, of which 84 patients with IBD + TE and 118 patients with IBD - TE, were included in this case-control study. Three clot lysis parameters (area under the curve, 50% clot lysis time, and amplitude) were determined using a clot lysis assay. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. PAI-1 antigen, active PAI-1, and intact thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor concentrations, as well as 50% clot lysis time and area under the curve, were significantly associated with the presence of IBD (all P < 0.05). The median time between TE and plasma collection was 5.0 (1.8-11.0) years. Comparing IBD + TE versus IBD - TE, active to total PAI-1 ratio (0.36 [0.24-0.61] versus 0.24 [0.13-0.40]), area under the curve (31 [24-49] versus 22 [13-31]), 50% clot lysis time (110 [64-132] versus 95 [70-126] minutes), and amplitude (0.295 [0.222-0.436] versus 0.241 [0.168-0.308]) were significantly higher in IBD + TE (all P <0.05) and remained higher after adjustment for age, gender, C-reactive protein, type of disease, presence of comorbidities, and disease activity.",2015,"['Bollen, Lize', 'Vande Casteele, Niels', 'Peeters, Miet', 'Van Assche, Gert', 'Ferrante, Marc', 'Van Moerkercke, Wouter', 'Declerck, Paul', 'Vermeire, Séverine', 'Gils, Ann']"
Bidirectional functions of thrombin on fibrinolysis: Evidence of thrombin-dependent enhancement of fibrinolysis provided by spontaneous plasma clot lysis.,"Besides procoagulant activity, thrombin exhibits anticoagulant and profibrinolytic activities. We demonstrated that the euglobulin clot lysis time (ECLT) was shortened by endogenously generated thrombin as a result of the inactivation of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). In contrast, thrombin suppressed fibrinolytic activity through the activation of thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI). Here, using three different clot lysis assays of the ECLT, the tissue plasminogen activator supplemented plasma clot lysis time (tPA-PCLT) and the spontaneous plasma clot lysis time (s-PCLT), we analyzed how the coagulation process modifies fibrinolysis. The ECLT was shortened by exogenously supplemented thrombin in a dose-dependent manner in the absence of calcium ion (Ca(++)), whereas this shortening was not observed in the presence of Ca(++) where endogenous prothrombin was effectively activated to thrombin. This shortening was also not observed for the tPA-PCLT, in which tPA is supplemented in excess and PAI-1 activity is mostly lost. On the contrary, thrombin dose-dependently prolonged the tPA-PCLT, which was mostly abolished by inhibitors of carboxypeptidase and activated FXIII, suggesting that the prolongation is TAFI- and Factor XIII-dependent. The s-PCLT was shortened when thrombin generation was boosted by supplementing tissue factor and phosphatidylserine together with Ca(++), which was more apparent in the presence of inhibitors of activated FXIII and activated TAFI. Thus, thrombin appeared to express its enhancing effect on fibrinolysis even in plasma, in addition to its inhibiting effect. These bidirectional functions of thrombin on fibrinolysis seem to take place on demand under different environments to maintain adequate vascular blood flow.",2016,"['Tomczyk, Martyna', 'Suzuki, Yuko', 'Sano, Hideto', 'Brzoska, Tomasz', 'Tanaka, Hiroki', 'Urano, Tetsumei']"
Direct microscopic monitoring of initial and dynamic clot lysis using plasmin or rt-PA in an in vitro flow system.,"Plasmin is a direct-acting thrombolytic agent with a favorable safety profile upon intra-arterial delivery in pre-clinical and phase I studies. However, the thrombolytic efficacy of plasmin, relative to that of rt-PA, remains to be established. We have compared the dynamics of clot lysis with plasmin or rt-PA in an in vitro perfusion system, in which thrombolytic agent is administered locally, allowed to induce lysis for short intervals, then washed with plasma in a re-circulation circuit. Whole blood human clots were prepared in observation chambers, exposed to plasmin or rt-PA at equimolar concentrations (1.2/1.0, 1.8/1.5 and 2.4/2.0 mg/ml) for measured intervals of time, followed by perfusion with human plasma. Clot size was monitored by digital analysis of sequential photographs obtained through an optical microscope. Plasma perfusion after incubation with thrombolytic agent rapidly removed superficial clot fragments. This initial decrease in clot size was greater with plasmin than with rt-PA when tested at the highest concentrations of agent (0.63 ± 0.11 vs. 0.30 ± 0.11, p=0.001 for clots with non-cross-linked fibrin and 0.53 ± 0.15 vs. 0.14 ± 0.15, p=0.02, for clots with cross-linked-fibrin). Subsequent clot lysis during plasma flow was greater after prior incubation with rt-PA. Longer incubation times of plasmin resulted in larger portions of the clot being washed free. Repeated plasmin incubations and plasma perfusions of a clot successfully induced stepwise reductions in clot size.",2014,"['Bizjak, Nina', 'Bajd, Franci', 'Vidmar, Jernej', 'Blinc, Aleš', 'Perme, Maja Pohar', 'Marder, Victor J', 'Novokhatny, Valery', 'Serša, Igor']"
Factors affecting clot lysis rates in patients with spontaneous intraventricular hemorrhage.,"In the treatment of severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), thrombolytic use and clot size are known to influence clot lysis rates. We evaluated the effect of other variables on IVH clot lysis rates among patients treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator or placebo. One hundred patients with IVH and intracerebral hemorrhage volume <30 mL requiring emergency external ventricular drainage from 2 multicenter trials were treated with intraventricular administration of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (n=78; 53 males, 25 females) or placebo (n=22; 7 males, 15 females). IVH volume was quantified daily by head CT. A segmented linear regression using an optimized spline knot for each patient was fit. Random effects linear regression was used to estimate the effect of prespecified patient characteristics on clot lysis rates over the first 6 days. Stability IVH volumes were larger in males (N=60; 54 ± 5 mL) than females (N=40; 36 ± 5 mL; P=0.01). Intraventricular thrombolytic treatment was associated with an increase in clot lysis rate of 14.6% of stability IVH volume/day before the spline knot compared with the placebo group (P<0.001). After adjustment for thrombolytic, higher baseline serum plasminogen and lower baseline platelet count were independently associated with an increase in clot lysis of 1.28%/day per 10-g/dL increase (P<0.001) and 0.70% /day per 10×10(3)/uL decrease (P<0.001) before the knot, respectively.",2012,"['Ziai, Wendy C', 'Muschelli, John', 'Thompson, Carol B', 'Keyl, Penelope M', 'Lane, Karen', 'Shao, Shuai', 'Hanley, Daniel F']"
Temporal changes in clot lysis and clot stability following tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery.,"Cardiac surgery induces a multifactorial coagulopathy. Regular use of tranexamic acid (TXA) is becoming standard of care. Clinical challenges include selecting optimal dosing regimen and balancing the benefit versus risk of additional dosing with antifibrinolytics. The objective was to evaluate the effect of TXA by assessing kinetic properties of plasma clot formation, clot stability, and clot fibrinolysis. The study was a prospective case follow-up of 28 patients undergoing cardiac surgery (mean age 63.9 years, 29% women). Blood samples were analysed at seven time points during the first 48 h after surgery. All patients were treated with TXA, 2 g at start surgery, 1 g during extra corporeal circulation, and 1 g after reversal of heparin. An automated clot lysis assay using tissue factor and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was performed to evaluate clot formation, stability, and fibrinolysis. TXA protects against facilitated fibrinolysis and induces up to 13-fold increase in clot stability. All patients showed complete resistance to tPA-induced fibrinolysis during the first 6 h after cardiac surgery declining to 33% of patients at 48 h. Impaired renal function was associated with prolonged resistance to tPA-induced fibrinolysis. Despite inhibition of fibrinolysis with TXA, the overall clot stability declines and the kinetic properties of clot formation were impaired after cardiac surgery. TXA induces a multifold increase in clot resistance to fibrinolysis but does not affect clot formation or clot stability. Monitoring the level of resistance to fibrinolysis may prevent overdosing in particular in patients with impaired renal function.",2016,"['Tang, Mariann', 'Wierup, Per', 'Rea, Catherine J', 'Ingerslev, Jrgen', 'Hjortdal, Vibeke E', 'Srensen, Benny']"
Investigation of a link between raised levels of pepsinogen in blood as a mediator of in-vitro clot lysis in acid and a cause of abnormal factor XIII screening tests.,"The in-vitro lysis of plasma clots in acetic acid generally indicates a Factor XIII deficiency that is confirmed by quantitative assay. However, there are two rare, poorly understood circumstances whereby clot lysis in acid occurs when factor XIII activity levels are normal: the presence of either an atypical antifactor XIII antibody, or an unknown acid-activated protease. Our centre has identified four patients with in-vitro clot lysis in acetic acid and normal FXIII levels by activity assay. Our aim was to determine whether the cause of this unusual result was an inhibitory antibody or an aspartic acid protease. In each case, we found an inhibitor that was not an IgG but showed characteristics of an acid protease, including that it was neutralized by pepstatin. The four patients had median pepsinogen I levels five-fold to 10-fold higher than the normal median of 89 μg/l. Pepsinogen II was increased by three-fold to six-fold, but from a lower baseline median of 6.5 μg/l. Cathepsin D levels were normal. Clot lysis in the acid test was observed when recombinant human pepsinogen I was added to normal plasma at similarly high concentrations as in patient samples, consistent with a role of an acid protease. Clot lysis also occurred with addition of pepsinogen II, but required four-fold to seven-fold more than in patient samples. Laboratories should be aware that a positive acid clot lysis test can be misleading if pepsinogen levels are raised and should not use this alone to diagnose FXIII deficiency.",2014,"['Duncan, Elizabeth M', 'Dale, Brian J', 'Lloyd, John V']"
"EspP, an Extracellular Serine Protease from Enterohemorrhagic E. coli, Reduces Coagulation Factor Activities, Reduces Clot Strength, and Promotes Clot Lysis.","EspP (E. coli secreted serine protease, large plasmid encoded) is an extracellular serine protease produced by enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157:H7, a causative agent of diarrhea-associated Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (D+HUS). The mechanism by which EHEC induces D+HUS has not been fully elucidated. We investigated the effects of EspP on clot formation and lysis in human blood. Human whole blood and plasma were incubated with EspP(WT )at various concentrations and sampled at various time points. Thrombin time (TT), prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), coagulation factor activities, and thrombelastgraphy (TEG) were measured.",2016,"['Kuo, Kevin H M', 'Khan, Shekeb', 'Rand, Margaret L', 'Mian, Hira S', 'Brnjac, Elena', 'Sandercock, Linda E', 'Akula, Indira', 'Julien, Jean-Philippe', 'Pai, Emil F', 'Chesney, Alden E']"
Efficacy and spatial distribution of ultrasound-mediated clot lysis in the absence of thrombolytics.,"Ultrasound and microbubble (MB) contrast agents accelerate clot lysis, yet clinical trials have been performed without defining optimal acoustic conditions. Our aim was to assess the effect of acoustic pressure and frequency on the extent and spatial location of clot lysis. Clots from porcine blood were created with a 2-mm central lumen for infusion of lipid-shelled perfluorocarbon MBs (1×10(7) ml(-1)) or saline. Therapeutic ultrasound at 0.04, 0.25, 1.05, or 2.00 MHz was delivered at a wide range of peak rarefactional acoustic pressure amplitudes (PRAPAs). Ultrasound was administered over 20 minutes grouped on-off cycles to allow replenishment of MBs. The region of lysis was quantified using contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging. In the absence of MBs, sonothrombolysis did not occur at any frequency. Sonothrombolysis was also absent in the presence of MBs despite their destruction at 0.04 and 2.00 MHz. It occurred at 0.25 and 1.05 MHz in the presence of MBs for PRAPAs > 1.2 MPa and increased with PRAPA. At 0.25 MHz the clot lysis was located in the far wall. At 1.05 MHz, however, there was a transition from far to near wall as PRAPA was increased. The area of clot lysis measured by ultrasound imaging correlated with that by micro-CT and quantification of debris in the effluent. In conclusion, sonothrombolysis with MBs was most efficient at 0.25 MHz. The spatial location of sonothrombolysis varies with pressure and frequency indicating that the geometric relation between therapeutic probe and vascular thrombosis is an important variable for successful lysis clinically.",2015,"['Ammi, Azzdine Y', 'Lindner, Jonathan R', 'Zhao, Yan', 'Porter, Thomas', 'Siegel, Robert', 'Kaul, Sanjiv']"
Increased plasma clot permeability and susceptibility to lysis are associated with heavy menstrual bleeding of unknown cause: a case-control study.,"Formation of compact and poorly lysable clots has been reported in thromboembolic disorders. Little is known about clot properties in bleeding disorders. We hypothesized that more permeable and lysis-sensitive fibrin clots can be detected in women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). We studied 52 women with HMB of unknown cause and 52 age-matched control women. Plasma clot permeability (Ks), turbidity and efficiency of fibrinolysis, together with coagulation factors, fibrinolysis proteins, and platelet aggregation were measured. Women with HMB formed looser plasma fibrin clots (+16% [95%CI 7-18%] Ks) that displayed lower maximum absorbancy (-7% [95%CI -9 - -1%] ΔAbsmax), and shorter clot lysis time (-17% [95%CI -23 - -11%] CLT). The HMB patients and controls did not differ with regard to coagulation factors, fibrinogen, von Willebrand antigen, thrombin generation markers and the proportion of subjects with defective platelet aggregation. The patients had lower platelet count (-12% [95%CI -19 - -2%]), tissue plasminogen activator antigen (-39% [95%CI -41 - -29%] tPA:Ag), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen (-28% [95%CI -38 - -18%] PAI-1:Ag) compared with the controls. Multiple regression analysis upon adjustment for age, body mass index, glucose, and fibrinogen showed that decreased tPA:Ag and shortened CLT were the independent predictors of HMB.",2015,"['Szczepaniak, Piotr', 'Zabczyk, Michał', 'Undas, Anetta']"
Short-term effect of infliximab is reflected in the clot lysis profile of patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a prospective study.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is recognized as an independent risk factor for thrombosis. First, we investigate whether the concentration of fibrinolysis inhibitors is increased in patients with IBD. Second, we investigate the effect of infliximab induction therapy on the hemostatic profile. This prospective study included 103 patients with IBD starting infliximab therapy and 113 healthy controls. Plasma was collected before the first infliximab infusion (wk 0) and after induction therapy (wk 14). Patients not showing a clinical response on induction were considered as primary nonresponders. Fibrinolysis inhibitors were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Using a clot lysis assay, the area under the curve (global marker for coagulation/fibrinolysis), 50% clot lysis time (marker for fibrinolytic capacity), and amplitude (indicator for clot formation) were determined. Patients with IBD selected for infliximab treatment have higher area under the curve (median 29 [interquartile range, 20-38]) and amplitude (0.4 [0.3-0.5]) compared with healthy controls (18 [13-24] and 0.3 [0.2-0.3], respectively, P < 0.001). Primary nonresponders showed a decrease neither in inflammatory markers nor in hemostatic parameters, whereas in primary responders, a decrease in inflammatory markers was associated with a decrease in both area under the curve (29 [20-38] (wk 0) to 20 [14-28] (wk 14), P < 0.001) and amplitude (0.4 [0.3-0.5] (wk 0) to 0.3 [0.3-0.4] (wk 14), P < 0.001).",2015,"['Bollen, Lize', 'Vande Casteele, Niels', 'Peeters, Miet', 'Bessonov, Kyrylo', 'Van Steen, Kristel', 'Rutgeerts, Paul', 'Ferrante, Marc', 'Hoylaerts, Marc F', 'Vermeire, Severine', 'Gils, Ann']"
Fibrinolytic PLGA nanoparticles for slow clot lysis within abdominal aortic aneurysms attenuate proteolytic loss of vascular elastic matrix.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) involve chronic overexpression of proteases in the aortic wall that result in disruption of elastic fibers and consequent loss of vessel elasticity. Nearly 75% of AAAs contain flow-obstructing, fibrin-rich intraluminal thrombi (ILT), which act as a) a bioinert shield, protecting the underlying AAA wall from high hemodynamic stresses, and b) a reservoir of inflammatory cells and proteases that cause matrix breakdown. For these reasons, restoring flow through the aorta lumen and facilitating transmural diffusion of therapeutics from circulation to the AAA wall must be achieved by slow thrombolysis of the ILT to render it porous without rapid breakdown. Intravenously dosed tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been shown to rapidly lyse ILTs in acute stroke and myocardial infarctions. For future use in opening up AAA segments, in this study, we investigated the ability of tPA released from poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA NPs) to slowly lyse fibrin clots without inducing proteolytic injury and matrix synthesis-inhibitory effects on cultured rat aneurysmal smooth muscle cells (EaRASMCs). Fibrin clot lysis time was greatly extended over that in presence of exogenous tPA. Surface functionalization of NPs with a cationic amphiphile allowed them to bind to anionic fibrin clot, release tPA at a slower rate and to lyse the clot as a front proceeding outwards in unlike the more rapid and homogenous lysis that occurred due to anionic PLGA NPs. Elastic matrix content was decreased in EaRASMC cultures exposed to byproducts of clot lysis with exogenous tPA, but not tPA-NPs, and was likely due to increased proteolytic activity (MMPs, plasmin) in EaRASMC cultures exposed to exogenous tPA-lysed clots. Our results suggest that gradual ILT lysis via slow release of tPA from NPs will be likely beneficial over exogenous tPA delivery in preserving elastic matrix content and attenuating matrilysis in the adjoining AAA wall, in vivo, while rendering the ILT porous to facilitate transmural delivery of endoluminally delivered AAA therapeutics.",2016,"['Sivaraman, Balakrishnan', 'Sylvester, Andrew', 'Ramamurthi, Anand']"
Assessment of fibrinolytic activity by measuring the lysis time of a tissue-factor-induced clot: a feasibility evaluation.,"A clot lysis time assay in which a tissue factor-induced fibrin clot is lysed by exogenously added tissue plasminogen activator has been recently reported. We evaluated the feasibility of clot lysis time in a routine hemostasis laboratory, and its correlation with thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels and changes with aging in 185 healthy participants. Clot lysis time was assessed by monitoring changes in turbidity during clot formation and subsequent lysis using a computerized kinetic spectrophotometric microtiter plate. After preliminary experiments, 100 and 160 ng/mL tissue plasminogen activator concentrations were chosen for the study. Clot lysis time was calculated by a new mathematical analysis of the lysis curve based on discrete derivative. Clot lysis time, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 plasma levels showed a normal distribution. For both concentrations of tissue plasminogen activator, clot lysis time progressively increased with increase in age (P < .0001) and was significantly correlated with thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor antigen, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor activity, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen (at least P < .01). During linear regression analysis, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen were found to significantly influence clot lysis time (at least P < .01). Clot lysis time determination has a good laboratory performance. Our new method of calculation is independent of the time of reading and allows a more accurate and consistent detection of both short and prolonged lysis times. Our data suggest the feasibility of the use of this test in the work of routine hemostasis laboratory.",2010,"['Cellai, Anna Paola', 'Lami, Donatella', 'Magi, Alberto', 'Liotta, Agatina Alessandrello', 'Rogolino, Angela', 'Antonucci, Emilia', 'Bandinelli, Brunella', 'Abbate, Rosanna', 'Prisco, Domenico']"
Clot Formation in the Presence of Acetylsalicylic Acid Leads to Increased Lysis Rates Regardless of the Chosen Thrombolysis Strategy.,"Patients with acute ischemic strokes frequently take an acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) premedication. We determined the impact of ASA on different thrombolysis strategies in vitro. For two clot types made from platelet-rich plasma (one with and one without ASA) lysis rates were measured by weight loss after 1 h for five different groups: in control group A clots were solely placed in plasma; in groups B and C clots were treated with rt-PA (60 kU/ml), and in groups D and E clots were treated with desmoteplase (DSPA; 2 µg/ml). Ultrasound (2 MHz, 0.179 W/cm2) was included in groups C and E. The fibrin mesh structures of the clots were investigated by electron microscopy. For both clot types lysis rates increased significantly for all treatment strategies compared to their control group (each p < 0.001). The addition of ASA significantly increased the lysis rate in all 5 groups (each p < 0.001) and led to a ceiling effect concerning the treatment. A semiquantitative analysis of transmission electron micrographs revealed a decreased fibrin density for clots with ASA. For both clot types DSPA and ultrasound led to a significant dissolution of the fibrin mesh (both p = 0.029).",2016,"['Roessler, Florian C', 'Schumacher, Sabrina', 'Sprenger, Andreas', 'Gärtner, Ulrich', 'Al-Khaled, Mohamed', 'Eggers, Jürgen']"
Evidence that fibrinogen γ' regulates plasma clot structure and lysis and relationship to cardiovascular risk factors in black Africans.,"Fibrinogen γ' is known to influence fibrin clot structure in purified experimental models, but little is known regarding its influence on clot structure in plasma. Furthermore, the environmental and biological factors that affect its concentration are poorly described. We analyzed fibrinogen γ', total fibrinogen concentration, and fibrin clot structure in 2010 apparently healthy black South Africans and related them to traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Fibrinogen γ' generally increased with increasing fibrinogen concentration, but a decreased γ'/total fibrinogen ratio was found at the highest total fibrinogen concentrations. Clot maximum absorbance increased with total fibrinogen and fibrinogen γ', but decreased with γ'/total fibrinogen ratio. Clot lysis time showed a stronger relationship with fibrinogen γ' than with total fibrinogen, whereby increased fibrinogen γ' delayed clot lysis. CVD risk factors (excluding fibrinogen) explained 20% and 3%, respectively, of the variance in fibrinogen γ' and the γ'/total fibrinogen ratio, with C-reactive protein making the biggest contribution. More than 50% of the variance in fibrinogen γ' and γ'/total fibrinogen ratio is explained by factors other than total fibrinogen or other traditional CVD risk factors. Our data show that fibrinogen γ' modulates plasma clot structure and fibrinolysis and is also influenced by factors other than fibrinogen.",2013,"['Pieters, Marlien', 'Kotze, Retha C', 'Jerling, Johann C', 'Kruger, Annamarie', 'Ariëns, Robert A S']"
Reduced plasma fibrin clot permeability and susceptibility to lysis are associated with increased risk of postthrombotic syndrome.,"The postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a severe complication of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Reduced plasma clot permeability and lysability have been linked to DVT and residual vein obstruction. OBJECTIVES We investigated whether altered fibrin clot properties are associated with the occurrence of PTS. Plasma fibrin clot permeability (Ks ) and lysability were investigated in a cohort of 197 consecutive patients aged 18 to 65 years recruited 3 months following the first-ever DVT. Patients with severe thrombophilia or comorbidities known to adversely affect clot phenotype were ineligible. During a 1-year follow-up PTS developed in 48 (24%) patients, who were characterized by lower Ks , prolonged fibrin clot lysis time (CLT) and slower release of D-dimer from clots (D-Drate ), together with higher plasma D-dimer, C-reactive protein and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI). No PTS-associated differences in fibrinogen, thrombin generation, factor VIII, other fibrinolysis proteins and the quality of anticoagulation were observed. Ks (r = -0.71), CLT (r = 0.45), D-Drate (r = -0.30) and TAFI activity (r = 0.38) were associated with the Villalta scale (all P < 0.05). Recurrent VTE occurred also more commonly in PTS patients during follow-up and the 26 (13.2%) patients had lower Ks , longer CLT and lower D-Drate (all P < 0.05). A multivariate model adjusted for age, body mass index, fibrinogen and glucose showed that independent predictors of PTS were idiopathic DVT, plasma D-dimer, Ks , D-Drate , tissue plasminogen activator and TAFI activity.",2016,"['Siudut, J', 'Grela, M', 'Wypasek, E', 'Plens, K', 'Undas, A']"
Purification and characterization of a novel C-type hemolytic lectin for clot lysis from the fresh water clam Villorita cyprinoides: a possible natural thrombolytic agent against myocardial infarction.,"Villorita cyprinoides (black clam) is a fresh water clam that belongs as a bivalve to the group of mollusc. The saline extracts from the muscle reveal high titers of agglutination potency on trypsin-treated rabbit erythrocytes. With the help of affinity chromatography a hemolytic protein with lectin activity which could all be inhibited by D-galactose were isolated. The lectins were separated on DEAE-cellulose and the main component was purified after an additional step of gel filtration on sephadex G-75. The main component is a non-glycosylated protein with a molecular weight of 96,560 Da determined by MALDI-ToF, consisting of a single protein chain and characterized by the lack of polymers and intermediate disulfide bonds. The pure main lectin with clot lytic feature shows two bands at molecular weights 36,360 and 26, 520 Da. Optimal inhibition of the pure lectin is achieved by D-galactose containing oligo- and polysaccharides. The lectin activity decreased above 40 °C and was lost at 62 °C, the stability over the pH range between 7.0 and 8.0 and requires divalent cations for their activity. The novel C-type hemolytic lectin for clot lysis from the clam Villorita cyprinoides was identified and evaluated, the purified hemolytic lectin (0.35 mg/ml and 0.175 mg/ml) enhanced clot lysis activity when compared to the different concentration (5 mg/ml and 1 mg/ml) of commercial streptokinase. In the present study identified hemolytic lectin was a rapid and effective clot lytic molecule and could be developed as new drug molecule in future.",2014,"['Sudhakar, G R Learnal', 'Vincent, S G Prakash']"
Comparison of clot lysis activity and biochemical properties of originator tenecteplase (Metalyse(®)) with those of an alleged biosimilar.,"The bioengineered tissue plasminogen activator tenecteplase is an important treatment modality of acute myocardial infarction recommended by international guidelines. Following introduction of originator tenecteplase (brand names Metalyse(®) and TNKase(®)), a ""biosimilar"" tenecteplase became available for commercial use in India under the brand name Elaxim(®) in the absence of Indian biosimilar guidelines which came into force from September 15th, 2012. Based on a report of biochemical and fibrinolytical differences between Metalyse and Elaxim, we have systematically compared them in a range of routine quality testing assays. As compared to Metalyse, Elaxim exhibited less clot lysis activity and contained less of the two-chain form of tenecteplase. Even upon full in vitro conversion to the two-chain form Elaxim exhibited less clot lysis activity. This was linked to differences in sialic acid content and glycosylation pattern with Elaxim exhibiting less bi- and more tetra-antennary glycosylation, leading to a different charge heterogeneity profile. Regarding purity, Elaxim contained more tenecteplase aggregates and, in contrast to Metalyse, considerable amounts of Chinese hamster ovary cell protein. Taken together these data demonstrate that Metalyse and Elaxim differ considerably in clot lysis activity and biochemical properties. These data question whether Elaxim indeed can be considered a ""biosimilar"" of Metalyse, i.e., whether and to which extent the clinical efficacy and safety properties of Metalyse can be extrapolated to Elaxim in the absence of comparative clinical data.",2014,"['Kliche, Werner', 'Krech, Ingo', 'Michel, Martin C', 'Sangole, Nishant V', 'Sathaye, Sadhana']"
Device and imaging-specific volumetric analysis of clot lysis after percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy for iliofemoral DVT.,"To determine the most accurate method of assessing clot lysis after percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy for iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and to evaluate the effectiveness of two different pharmacomechanical thrombectomy devices. Between 2004 and 2009, 33 patients (18 women; mean age 47 years) with iliofemoral DVT underwent pharmacomechanical thrombectomy using the AngioJet (n = 18) or Trellis (n = 15) devices with 10 mg of tenecteplase. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and venography were performed over the iliofemoral segments before and after treatment. Cross-sectional vessel and lumen diameters were measured from the IVUS scans and the post-procedure anteroposterior and lateral venograms at 3 points (proximal, mid-section, and distal) along each iliofemoral vein by 2 independent observers blinded to the treatment method. Volumes of the recanalized segments were calculated and compared to volumes of the original venous segments to assess clot lysis with each PMT device. IVUS scans and venograms were also compared for their ability to identify residual lesions or clot in need of treatment. Repeatability between and among observers was analyzed using the Bland and Altman method. All procedures were successfully completed; there were only 2 minor bleeding complications. The mean volume of the recanalized segment was 2255+/-66 mm(3) by IVUS, representing 80% lysis of the clot compared to what was perceived as >90% lysis with venography (p<0.05). IVUS was able to delineate significant residual thrombus, stenosis, or May-Thurner anatomy requiring ancillary interventions in 100% of patients versus 48% (16/33) on the venograms (p<0.01). Quantitative assessments of the diameters of the involved venous segments from the venograms and IVUS were consistent between and among observers. Comparing the similar patient subgroups, AngioJet resulted in greater clot lysis (88%) versus the Trellis device (72%; p<0.01), corresponding to recanalized venous segment volumes of 2486+/-74 and 2025+/-57 mm(3) and total venous segment volumes of 2826+/-84 and 2813+/-79 mm(3), respectively.",2010,"['Murphy, Erin H', 'Broker, Harshal S', 'Johnson, Eric J', 'Modrall, J Gregory', 'Valentine, R James', 'Arko, Frank R']"
"Analysis of plasmin generation and clot lysis of plasma fibrinogen purified from a heterozygous dysfibrinogenemia, BbetaGly15Cys (Hamamatsu II).","We found a heterozygous dysfibrinogenemia caused by the substitution of BbetaGly15Cys and designated it fibrinogen Hamamatsu II (H-II). Although the propositus suffered an infarction of the medulla oblongata, other thrombotic risk factors, paradoxical cerebral infarction, and arterial dissection were not found. To determine whether the delayed lysis of fibrin clots or not in the context of the BbetaGly15Cys substitution, we examined the clot lysis and plasmin generation of propositus' fibrinogen. Fibrinogen was purified from the propositus' and normal control plasma by immunoaffinity chromatography and was used for the following experiments: sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, fibrin polymerization, scanning electron microscopic observation of fibrin clot and fibers, clot lysis, and tissue-type plasminogen activator-mediated plasminogen activation. The H-II plasma fibrinogen showed the presence of albumin-binding variant forms, a dimeric molecule of variant fibrinogen, and impairment of lateral aggregation during fibrin polymerization. The H-II fibrin clot showed lower density of bundles and thinner diameters of fibers than in the normal fibrin clot. In the clot lysis experiments with overlaid plasmin, H-II fibrin showed a similar lysis period and lysis rate to the normal control. Moreover, plasmin generation from a mixture of thrombin, tissue-type plasminogen activator, plasminogen, and H-II fibrinogen also showed a similar rate to normal fibrinogen. Although the propositus suffered an infarction, the present study did not observe delayed clot lysis, that is, the clot was not resistant to plasmin degradation. Therefore, we did not clarify an association between the BbetaGly15Cys dysfibrinogenemia and arterial thrombosis.",2009,"['Kamijyo, Yuka', 'Hirota-Kawadobora, Masako', 'Yamauchi, Kazuyoshi', 'Terasawa, Fumiko', 'Honda, Takayuki', 'Ikeya, Manae', 'Okumura, Nobuo']"
Weight reduction is associated with increased plasma fibrin clot lysis.,"Obesity is associated with an increased risk of vascular thrombotic events. We sought to investigate how obesity and weight loss affect plasma fibrin clot properties. A total of 29 obese patients were studied before and after 3-month low-fat diet. Plasma fibrin clot parameters, including fibrin clot permeation coefficient (Ks), the lag phase of the turbidity curve, clot lysis time (t 50%), maximum rate of increase in D-dimer levels, and maximum D-dimer concentrations, were determined. Low-fat diet resulted in the reduction of body weight (P < .0001), body mass index (P < .0001), fat mass (P < .0001), total cholesterol (P < .0001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = .0005), triglycerides (P = .008), and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (P = .02), but not in fibrinogen or C-reactive protein. The only change in fibrin clot variables was shorter t 50% (P = .02). Baseline t 50%, but not posttreatment, correlated with waist circumference (r = .44, p = .02). This study demonstrates that weight loss in obese people can increase the efficiency of fibrin clot lysis.",2014,"['Brzezińska-Kolarz, Beata', 'Kolarz, Marek', 'Wałach, Angelika', 'Undas, Anetta']"
Reduced plasma fibrin clot permeability and susceptibility to lysis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a novel prothrombotic mechanism.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism. Its mechanism is still unclear. Altered fibrin clot properties have been reported in patients with thromboembolism and those with chronic inflammatory states. We investigated whether fibrin characteristics are abnormal in IBD. Ex vivo plasma fibrin clot permeability (Ks), compaction, turbidity, and efficiency of fibrinolysis were assessed in 85 consecutive patients with IBD, including 47 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 38 with Crohn's disease (CD), all with no history of thromboembolism. Forty-eight patients matched for age and sex served as controls. Compared with controls, patients with UC and CD had 29.5% and 35.7% lower Ks associated with 13.8% and 23.1% lower compaction, respectively (all P < 0.001). Patients with UC and CD had higher maximum clot absorbance (+8.9%, P = 0.008, and +15.2%, P < 0.0001, respectively), higher maximum D-dimer released from clots (D-D(max), +27.0%, P = 0.01, and +28.7%, P < 0.0001, respectively), and prolonged clot lysis time (+19.0%, P < 0.0001, and +25.5%, P < 0.0001, respectively). Lag phase was similar in both group of patients. D-D(max) was the only parameter that differed between patients in the UC and CD groups, being higher in CD (P = 0.04). The multiple linear regression model showed that in patients with UC, but not with CD, Ks, compaction, lysis time, and D-D(max) were all independently associated with disease activity. In patients with CD, Ks and lysis time were independently predicted by fibrinogen and C-reactive protein.",2013,"['Owczarek, Danuta', 'Cibor, Dorota', 'Sałapa, Kinga', 'Głowacki, Mikołaj K', 'Mach, Tomasz', 'Undas, Anetta']"
Clot lysis phenotype and response to recombinant factor VIIa in plasma of haemophilia A inhibitor patients.,"Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) is a haemostatic agent that is used for the treatment of haemophilia A patients with inhibitors. However, clinical response to rFVIIa is variable and unpredictable with currently available assays. We investigated the anti-fibrinolytic effects of rFVIIa in relation to thrombin generation (TG) and other haemostatic parameters in haemophilia A patients with inhibitors. After addition of rFVIIa to plasma, the clot-lysis assay, TF-dependent TG, TF-independent TG and parameters involved in coagulation, anticoagulation and fibrinolysis were assessed. The clot-lysis test distinguished two groups of patients: a group with a normal and a group with impaired anti-fibrinolytic response to rFVIIa. Our results showed a dose-dependent increase in TF-dependent TG and TF-independent TG in all individuals. There was a significant difference in TF-independent TG parameters between the normal and impaired response groups. In addition, there was a difference between the normal and impaired response group in prothrombin time, which could be explained by significantly higher levels of coagulation factors in the normal response group, and soluble thrombomodulin. In conclusion, we observed different in vitro responses following rFVIIa addition in plasma of patients with haemophilia A and inhibitors, which could be partially attributed to levels of procoagulant proteins and soluble thrombomodulin.",2013,"['Bakhtiari, Kamran', 'Kamphuisen, Pieter W', 'Mancuso, Maria E', 'Hamulyak, Karly', 'Schutgens, Roger E G', 'Santagostino, Elena', 'Meijers, Joost C M']"
The association of clot lysis time with total obesity is partly independent from the association of PAI-1 with central obesity in African adults.,"Preliminary evidence indicates that the association of fibrinolytic potential, measured as clot lysis time (CLT), with body composition may differ from that of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1). We therefore investigated the association between fibrinolytic markers (plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 activity (PAI-1act) and CLT) and body composition using detailed body composition analyses. Data from 1288 Africans were cross-sectionally analyzed. Body composition analysis included BMI, waist circumference (WC); waist to height ratio (WHtR), skinfolds and body fat percentage measured with air-displacement plethysmography and bioelectrical impedance analysis. PAI-1act and CLT were significantly higher in women than in men, despite adjustment for differences in body composition. PAI-1act and CLT showed similar linear positive relationships with body composition (BMI, WC, WHtR, skinfolds) in men. In women CLT also showed a linear relationship with body composition, while PAI-1act levels plateaued at higher BMI and did not differ across skinfold categories. PAI-1act showed stronger correlations with body composition markers in men than it did in women, while no sex differences existed for CLT. PAI-1act associated more strongly with central obesity, while CLT associated with total body fat.",2015,"['Eksteen, Philna', 'Pieters, Marlien', 'de Lange, Zelda', 'Kruger, Herculina S']"
Visualization of clot lysis in a rat embolic stroke model: application to comparative lytic efficacy.,"The purpose of this study was to develop a novel MRI method for imaging clot lysis in a rat embolic stroke model and to compare tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-based clot lysis with and without recombinant Annexin-2 (rA2). In experiment 1 we used in vitro optimization of clot visualization using multiple MRI contrast agents in concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 μL in 250 μL blood. In experiment 2, we used in vivo characterization of the time course of clot lysis using the clot developed in the previous experiment. Diffusion, perfusion, angiography, and T1-weighted MRI for clot imaging were conducted before and during treatment with vehicle (n=6), tPA (n=8), or rA2 plus tPA (n=8) at multiple time points. Brains were removed for ex vivo clot localization. Clots created with 25 μL Magnevist were the most stable and provided the highest contrast-to-noise ratio. In the vehicle group, clot length as assessed by T1-weighted imaging correlated with histology (r=0.93). Clot length and cerebral blood flow-derived ischemic lesion volume were significantly smaller than vehicle at 15 minutes after treatment initiation in the rA2 plus tPA group, whereas in the tPA group no significant reduction from vehicle was observed until 30 minutes after treatment initiation. The rA2 plus tPA group had a significantly shorter clot length than the tPA group at 60 and 90 minutes after treatment initiation and significantly smaller cerebral blood flow deficit than the tPA group at 90 minutes after treatment initiation.",2011,"['Walvick, Ronn P', 'Bråtane, Bernt T', 'Henninger, Nils', 'Sicard, Kenneth M', 'Bouley, James', 'Yu, Zhanyang', 'Lo, Eng', 'Wang, Xiaoying', 'Fisher, Marc']"
Sonothrombolysis: the contribution of stable and inertial cavitation to clot lysis.,"Microbubble-mediated sonothrombolysis (STL) is a remarkable approach to vascular occlusion therapy. However, STL remains a complex process with multiple interactions between clot, ultrasound (US), microbubbles (MB) and thrombolytic drug. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of combining US and MB to degrade fibrin and, more specifically, to assess the roles of both stable (SC) and inertial (IC) cavitation. Human blood clots containing radiolabeled fibrin were exposed to different combinations of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), US (1 MHz) and phospholipid MB. Three acoustic pressures were tested: 200, 350 and 1,300 kPa (peak-negative pressure). Clot lysis was assessed by diameter loss and release of radioactive fibrin degradation products. The combination rtPA + US + MB clearly revealed that IC (1,300 kPa) was able to enhance fibrin degradation significantly (66.3 ± 1.8%) compared with rtPA alone (51.7 ± 2.0%, p < 0.001). However, SC failed to enhance fibrin degradation at an acoustic pressure of 200 kPa. At 350 kPa, a synergistic effect between rtPA and US + MB was observed with an absolute increase of 6% compared to rtPA alone (p < 0.001). Conversely, without rtPA, the combination of US + MB was unable to degrade the fibrin network (0.3 ± 0.1%, p > 0.05 vs. control), but induced a distinct loss of red blood cells throughout the entire thickness of the clot, implying that MB were able to penetrate and cavitate inside the clot.",2015,"['Petit, B', 'Bohren, Y', 'Gaud, E', 'Bussat, P', 'Arditi, M', 'Yan, F', 'Tranquart, F', 'Allémann, E']"
Identification of an inflammatory bowel disease patient with a deep vein thrombosis and an altered clot lysis profile.,"Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by flares and remission, are prone to develop thrombosis. The mechanism behind this prothrombotic state is not completely understood but is definitely multifactorial and linked with excessive inflammation observed in these patients. So far, no biomarker exists to select among IBD patients those with and increased risk for thrombosis. Corticosteroid therapy, given as rescue IBD treatment, is known to increase the thrombotic risk, whereas for antitumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha therapy such as infliximab, given to induce and maintain remission in IBD, the results are inconclusive. Here, we describe a 31-year-old IBD patient who developed a deep vein thrombosis. We determined the clot lysis profiles before and after developing thrombosis. We showed that a global functional clot lysis assay can be used as a tool to identify IBD patients who may benefit from thromboprophylactic therapy.",2016,"['Bollen, Lize', 'Wuyts, Joke', 'Vermeire, Séverine', 'Gils, Ann']"
Acute cigarette smoke exposure reduces clot lysis--association between altered fibrin architecture and the response to t-PA.,"Enhanced thrombolysis is a proposed mechanism for reduced mortality in cigarette smokers with STEMI (""smoker's paradox""). The mechanisms remain unclear but studies suggest fibrin architecture (FA) may affect thrombolysis. Our group has previously shown that acute cigarette smoke exposure (CSE) alters FA. This study was done to evaluate the association between FA, thrombolysis and CSE. Otherwise healthy smokers (n=22) were studied before and after smoking two cigarettes. Non-smokers (n=22) served as controls. Two ex-vivo models were used to evaluate clot lysis of venous blood and these data were compared to FA as determined by SEM. In the first model, clot lysis in a glass tube at 60minutes after addition of t-PA was measured. The second model quantified lysis utilizing thromboelastography. With the latter, after a clot reached maximum strength, t-PA was added and clot lysis at 60min was noted. SEM studies were performed on platelet poor plasma mixed with thrombin and FA was examined at 20K. Clot lysis was similar in both groups except that post-smoking, TEG showed a significantly lower lysis compared to pre- and non-smoking clots. SEM analysis showed significantly thinner fibers and denser clots post-smoking.",2010,"['Barua, Rajat S', 'Sy, Fridolin', 'Srikanth, Sundararajan', 'Huang, Grace', 'Javed, Usman', 'Buhari, Cyrus', 'Margosan, Dennis', 'Aftab, Waqas', 'Ambrose, John A']"
Exome Sequencing and Clot Lysis Experiments Demonstrate the R458C Mutation of the Alpha Chain of Fibrinogen to be Associated with Impaired Fibrinolysis in a Family with Thrombophilia.,"We report the study of a familial rare disease with recurrent venous thromboembolic events that remained undiagnosed for many years using standard coagulation and hemostasis techniques. Exome sequencing was performed in three familial cases with venous thromboembolic disease and one familial control using NimbleGen exome array. Clot lysis experiments were performed to analyze the reasons of the altered fibrinolytic activity caused by the mutation found. We found a mutation that consists of a R458C substitution on the fibrinogen alpha chain (FGA) gene confirmed in 13 new familial subjects that causes a rare subtype of dysfibrinogenemia characterized by venous thromboembolic events. The mutation was already reported to be associated with a fibrinogen variant called fibrinogen Bordeaux. Clot-lysis experiments showed a decreased and slower fibrinolytic activity in carriers of this mutation as compared to normal subjects, thus demonstrating an impaired fibrinolysis of fibrinogen Bordeaux.",2016,"['Fernández-Cadenas, Israel', 'Penalba, Anna', 'Boada, Cristina', 'MsC, Caty Carrerra', 'Bueno, Santiago Rodriguez', 'Quiroga, Adoración', 'Monasterio, Jasone', 'Delgado, Pilar', 'Anglés-Cano, Eduardo', 'Montaner, Joan']"
"Clot lysis time in platelet-rich plasma: method assessment, comparison with assays in platelet-free and platelet-poor plasmas, and response to tranexamic acid.","Fibrinolysis dysfunctions cause bleeding or predisposition to thrombosis. Platelets contain several factors of the fibrinolytic system, which could up or down regulate this process. However, the temporal relationship and relative contributions of plasma and platelet components in clot lysis are mostly unknown. We developed a clot lysis time (CLT) assay in platelet-rich plasma (PRP-CLT, with and without stimulation) and compared it to a similar one in platelet-free plasma (PFP) and to another previously reported test in platelet-poor plasma (PPP). We also studied the differential effects of a single dose of tranexamic acid (TXA) on these tests in healthy subjects. PFP- and PPP-CLT were significantly shorter than PRP-CLT, and the three assays were highly correlated (p < 0.0001). PFP- and PPP-, but more significantly PRP-CLT, were positively correlated with age and plasma PAI-1, von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides (p < 0.001). All these CLT assays had no significant correlations with platelet aggregation/secretion, platelet counts, and pro-coagulant tests to explore factor X activation by platelets, PRP clotting time, and thrombin generation in PRP. Among all the studied variables, PFP-CLT was independently associated with plasma PAI-1, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides and, additionally, stimulated PRP-CLT was also independently associated with plasma fibrinogen. A single 1 g dose of TXA strikingly prolonged all three CLTs, but in contrast to the results without the drug, the lysis times were substantially shorter in non-stimulated or stimulated PRP than in PFP and PPP. This standardized PRP-CLT may become a useful tool to study the role of platelets in clot resistance and lysis. Our results suggest that initially, the platelets enmeshed in the clot slow down the fibrinolysis process. However, the increased clot resistance to lysis induced by TXA is overcome earlier in platelet-rich clots than in PFP or PPP clots. This is likely explained by the display of platelet pro-fibrinolytic effects. Focused research is needed to disclose the mechanisms for the relationship between CLT and plasma cholesterol and its potential pathophysiologic and clinical relevance.",2012,"['Panes, Olga', 'Padilla, Oslando', 'Matus, Valeria', 'Sáez, Claudia G', 'Berkovits, Alejandro', 'Pereira, Jaime', 'Mezzano, Diego']"
In vitro whole blood clot lysis for fibrinolytic activity study using d-dimer and confocal microscopy.,"This study aimed to evaluate in vitro whole blood (WB) clot lysis method for the assessment of fibrinolytic activity. Standardized unresected (uncut) retracted WB clot was incubated in pool platelet poor plasma (PPP) for varying incubation times and in streptokinase (SK) at different concentrations. The fibrinolytic activity was assessed by D-dimer (DD), confocal microscopy, and clot weight. DD was measured photometrically by immunoturbidimetric method. There was a significant difference in mean DD levels according to SK concentrations (P = 0.007). The mean DD ± SD according to the SK concentrations of 5, 30, 50, and 100 IU/mL was: 0.69 ± 0.12, 0.78 ± 0.14, 1.04 ± 0.14 and 2.40 ± 1.09  μ g/mL. There were no significant changes of clot weight at different SK concentrations. Gradual loss and increased branching of fibrin in both PPP and SK were observed. Quantitation of DD and morphology of fibrin loss as observed by the imaging features are in keeping with fibrinolytic activity. Combination of DD levels and confocal microscopic features was successfully applied to evaluate the in vitro WB clot lysis method described here.",2014,"['Elnager, Abuzar', 'Abdullah, Wan Zaidah', 'Hassan, Rosline', 'Idris, Zamzuri', 'Wan Arfah, Nadiah', 'Sulaiman, S A', 'Mustafa, Zulkifli']"
Impaired plasma clot lysis and its determinants in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.,"Evidence indicates that hypercoagulability and impaired fibrinolysis have been observed in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). It is unclear which factors determine prolonged fibrin clot lysis in OSAS. One hundred and sixty-five consecutive patients suspected of OSAS underwent overnight polysomnography. Prior to polysomnography, we determined plasma clot lysis time (CLT), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 antigen, activated thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFIa), plasmin, and antiplasmin. OSAS was diagnosed in 110 (66.7%) patients, including 35 (31.8%) with severe OSAS, 26 (23.6%) with moderate OSAS, and 49 (44.6%) mild OSAS. Compared with 55 (33.3%) individuals in whom OSAS was not confirmed, OSAS patients had prolonged CLT (+12.8%), associated with higher PAI-1 antigen (+18.1%) (after adjustment for age, diabetes, and body mass index; both P < 0.01) and similar levels of TAFIa, plasmin, or antiplasmin. PAI-1, TAFIa, and CLT correlated positively with apnea/hypopnea index, which reflects the severity of OSAS (R = 0.66, P < 0.001; R = 0.29, P = 0.002; R = 0.55, P = 0.001, respectively), and with other polysomnography parameters, with the most potent correlations observed for desaturation index. Regression analysis adjusted for potential confounders showed that in OSAS, CLT was independently predicted by apnea/hypopnea index (B = 0.29, P = 0.002), PAI-1 (B = 0.42, P < 0.001), and TAFIa (B = 0.81, P = 0.044), whereas both PAI-1 and TAFIa were predicted only by desaturation index (B = 0.24, P = 0.002; and B = 0.14, P = 0.001, respectively). The severity of OSAS is closely associated with hypofibrinolysis measured in a global plasma-based assay, driven largely by PAI-1.

Simvastatin increases clot permeability and susceptibility to lysis in patients with LDL cholesterol below 3.4 mmol/l.,"Statins produce additional beneficial effects, including attenuation of prothrombotic mechanisms. In patients at high cardiovascular risk, who have markedly elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, simvastatin can reduce thrombin generation. Moreover, we have described simvastatin-induced improvement of fibrin clot properties, the formation of which represents the final step of blood coagulation. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of simvastatin on fibrin features observed in subjects with LDL cholesterol <3.4 mmol/l. Thirty subjects (24M, 6F) aged <70 years with LDL cholesterol <3.4 mmol/l with no history of cardiovascular events were enrolled in the study. Patients were excluded if they had diabetes mellitus, chronic inflammatory diseases and renal insufficiency. Prior to and following a 3-month treatment with simvastatin (40 mg/d), ex vivo plasma fibrin clot permeability and efficiency of clot lysis were measured. Simvastatin led to a significant decrease in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and C-reactive protein (CRP), while fibrinogen levels remained unaltered. There were posttreatment increase in clot permeability by 4.4% (p<0.001) and shortening of clot lysis by 11.2% (p<0.001) compared to pretreatment values. These changes were correlated with reduction in CRP following simvastatin. Simvastatin-induced increase in clot permeability was associated only with age and decrease in CRP levels (R2 for the model = 0.61), while shortening of clot lysis time observed following simvastatin use was predicted only by reduction of triglycerides and CRP (R2 for the model = 0.62).",2009,"['Undas, Anetta', 'Topór-Madry, Roman', 'Tracz, Wiesława']"
Effect of von Willebrand factor on clot structure and lysis.,"Von Willebrand Factor (vWF) is constitutively secreted by the endothelium and incorporated in the fibrin clots under slow clotting conditions. The aim of the present work was to study the effect of vWF on clot structure and lysis. Purified fibrinogen was mixed with vWF or Tris-buffered saline and clotted with thrombin - activated factor XIII. Fibrin polymerization was followed by turbidity at 350 nm during 2.5 h. After this time, plasmin was added on the top of the clots, and the optical density (OD) was read until baseline values. vWF effect on network[Combining Acute Accent]s porosity was evaluated by permeation using the same clotting conditions as for fibrin polymerization. Clot structure was visualized and analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). The rate of fibrin polymerization was 1.47 mOD/s in the presence of vWF and 0.5 mOD/s when vWF was not added (P < 0.05). The fibrin lysis rate was approximately four times faster when vWF was added to fibrinogen. The fibrin network porosity was (20.4 ± 1.6) × 10 cm with vWF and (8.3 ± 1.2) × 10 cm without external vWF (P < 0.05). The analysis of LSCM images showed that vWF increased fibrin fibers diameter and the networks[Combining Acute Accent] pores size. In conclusion, vWF covalently crosslinked to fibrin modify its structure (increases fibrin diameter and the pores filling space of the meshwork) that accelerates the fibrin lysis rate.",2015,"['Marchi, Rita', 'Rojas, Héctor']"
Biological activity analysis of native and recombinant streptokinase using clot lysis and chromogenic substrate assay.,"DETERMINATION OF STREPTOKINASE ACTIVITY IS USUALLY ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH TWO ASSAY METHODS: a) Clot lysis, b) Chromogenic substrate assay. In this study the biological activity of two streptokinase products, namely Streptase®, which is a native product and Heberkinasa®, which is a recombinant product, was determined against the third international reference standard using the two forementioned assay methods. The results indicated that whilst the activity of Streptase® was found to be 101 ± 4% and 97 ± 5% of the label claim with Clot lysis and Chromogenic substrate assay respectively, for Heberkinasa® the potency values obtained were 42 ± 5% and 92.5 ± 2% of the label claim respectively. To shed some light on the reason for this finding, the n-terminal sequence of the streptokinase molecules present in the two products was determined. The results showed slight differences in the amino acid sequence of the recombinant product in comparison to the native one at the amino terminus. This finding supports those of other workers who found that n-terminal sequence of the streptokinase molecule can have significant effect on the activity of this protein.",2012,"['Mahboubi, Arash', 'Sadjady, Seyyed Kazem', 'Mirzaei Saleh Abadi, Mohammad', 'Azadi, Saeed', 'Solaimanian, Roya']"
"In black South Africans from rural and urban communities, the 4G/5G PAI-1 polymorphism influences PAI-1 activity, but not plasma clot lysis time.","Data on genetic and environmental factors influencing PAI-1 levels and their consequent effect on clot lysis in black African populations are limited. We identified polymorphisms in the promoter area of the PAI-1 gene and determined their influence on PAI-1act levels and plasma clot lysis time (CLT). We also describe gene-environment interactions and the effect of urbanisation. Data from 2010 apparently healthy urban and rural black participants from the South African arm of the PURE study were cross-sectionally analysed. The 5G allele frequency of the 4G/5G polymorphism was 0.85. PAI-1act increased across genotypes in the urban subgroup (p = 0.009) but not significantly in the rural subgroup, while CLT did not differ across genotypes. Significant interaction terms were found between the 4G/5G polymorphism and BMI, waist circumference and triglycerides in determining PAI-1act, and between the 4G/5G polymorphism and fibrinogen and fibrinogen gamma prime in determining CLT. The C428T and G429A polymorphisms did not show direct relationships with PAI-1act or CLT but they did influence the association of other environmental factors with PAI-1act and CLT. Several of these interactions differed significantly between rural and urban subgroups, particularly in individuals harbouring the mutant alleles. In conclusion, although the 4G/5G polymorphism significantly affected PAI-1act, it contributed less than 1% to the PAI-1act variance. (Central) obesity was the biggest contributor to PAI-1act variance (12.5%). Urbanisation significantly influenced the effect of the 4G/5G polymorphism on PAI-1act as well as gene-environment interactions for the C428T and G429A genotypes in determining PAI-1act and CLT.",2013,"['de Lange, Zelda', 'Rijken, Dingeman C', 'Hoekstra, Tiny', 'Conradie, Karin R', 'Jerling, Johann C', 'Pieters, Marlien']"
Prolonged clot lysis time increases the risk of a first but not recurrent venous thrombosis.,"The role of the fibrinolytic system in the development of venous thrombosis (VT) is unclear. We studied the risk of first and recurrent VT associated with reduced fibrinolysis, as measured by clot lysis time (CLT). We also studied the relationship between CLT and thrombin generation to determine if any relationship between CLT and VT was affected by thrombin generation. Analyses were performed in the Thrombophilia Hypercoagulability Environmental risk for Venous Thromboembolism Study, a two-centre population-based case-control study, including 579 patients and 338 controls, with patients followed from the event to determine incidence of recurrent VT. Hypofibrinolysis was associated with a 1·8-fold increased risk of a first VT [95% confidence interval (CI) 1·2-2·7]. Adjustment for sex, age, study location and Endogenous Thrombin Potential (ETP) did not change the result. The risk of VT was 2·9-fold increased when the 90th percentiles of prolonged CLT and high ETP were combined, with the highest risk for unprovoked first events (Odds Ratio = 4·2, 95% CI 1·3-13·5). In the follow-up study the Hazard Ratio for a recurrent VT associated with hypofibrinolysis was 1·5 (95% CI 0·9-2·6). A weak dose response effect was observed in relation to prolongation of CLT and recurrent VT. Although hypofibrinolysis constitutes a risk factor for a first VT, an association with recurrence is, at best, weak.",2016,"['Karasu, Alev', 'Baglin, Trevor P', 'Luddington, Roger', 'Baglin, Caroline A', 'van Hylckama Vlieg, Astrid']"
Catheter placement for lysis of spontaneous intracerebral hematomas: does a catheter position in the core of the hematoma allow more effective and faster hematoma lysis?,"For the fibrinolytic therapy of intracerebral hematomas (ICH) using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), a catheter position in the core of the hematoma along the largest clot diameter was assumed to be optimal for an effective clot lysis. However, it never had been proven that core position indeed enhances clot lysis if compared with less optimal catheter positions. In this study, the impact of the catheter position on the effectiveness and on the time course of clot lysis was evaluated. We analyzed the catheter position using a relative error calculating the distance perpendicular to the catheter's center in relation to hematoma's diameter and evaluated the relative hematoma volume reduction (RVR). The correlation of the RVR with the catheter position was evaluated. Additionally, we tried to identify patterns of clot lysis with different catheter positions. The patient's outcome at discharge was evaluated using the Glasgow outcome score. A total of 105 patients were included in the study. The mean hematoma volume was 56 ml. The overall RVR was 62.7 %. In 69 patients, a catheter position in the core of the clot was achieved. We found no significant correlation between catheter position and hematoma RVR (linear regression, p = 0.14). Core catheter position leads to more symmetrical hematoma RVR. Faster clot lysis happens in the vicinity of the catheter openings. We found no significant difference in the patient's outcome dependent on the catheter position (linear regression, p = 0.90). The catheter position in the core of the hematoma along its largest diameter does not significantly influence the effectiveness of clot lysis after rtPA application.",2016,"['Malinova, Vesna', 'Schlegel, Anna', 'Rohde, Veit', 'Mielke, Dorothee']"
"Changes in clot lysis levels of reteplase and streptokinase following continuous wave ultrasound exposure, at ultrasound intensities following attenuation from the skull bone.","Ultrasound (US) has been used to enhance thrombolytic therapy in the treatment of stroke. Considerable attenuation of US intensity is however noted if US is applied over the temporal bone. The aim of this study was therefore to explore possible changes in the effect of thrombolytic drugs during low-intensity, high-frequency continuous-wave ultrasound (CW-US) exposure. Clots were made from fresh venous blood drawn from healthy volunteers. Each clot was made from 1.4 ml blood and left to coagulate for 1 hour in a plastic test-tube. The thrombolytic drugs used were, 3600 IU streptokinase (SK) or 0.25 U reteplase (r-PA), which were mixed in 160 ml 0.9% NaCl solution. Continuous-wave US exposure was applied at a frequency of 1 MHz and intensities ranging from 0.0125 to 1.2 W/cm2. For each thrombolytic drug (n = 2, SK and r-PA) and each intensity (n = 9) interventional clots (US-exposed, n = 6) were submerged in thrombolytic solution and exposed to CW-US while control clots (also submerged in thrombolytic solution, n = 6) were left unexposed to US.To evaluate the effect on clot lysis, the haemoglobin (Hb) released from each clot was measured every 20 min for 1 hour (20, 40 and 60 min). The Hb content (mg) released was estimated by spectrophotometry at 540 nm. The difference in effect on clot lysis was expressed as the difference in the amount of Hb released between pairs of US-exposed clots and control clots. Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon's signed rank test. Continuous-wave ultrasound significantly decreased the effects of SK at intensities of 0.9 and 1.2 W/cm2 at all times (P < 0.05). Continuous-wave ultrasound significantly increased the effects of r-PA on clot lysis following 20 min exposure at 0.9 W/cm2 and at 1.2 W/cm2, following 40 min exposure at 0.3, 0.6, 0.9 and at 1.2 W/cm2, and following 60 min of exposure at 0.05 0.3, 0.6, 0.9 and at 1.2 W/cm2 (all P < 0.05).",2008,"['Härdig, Bjarne Madsen', 'Carlson, Jonas', 'Roijer, Anders']"
Peroxynitrite may affect fibrinolysis via the reduction of platelet-related fibrinolysis resistance and alteration of clot structure.,"We tested the hypothesis that in vitro peroxynitrite (ONOO(-), a product of activated inflammatory cells) may affect fibrinolysis in human blood through the reduction of platelet-related fibrinolysis resistance. It was found that ONOO(-) (25-300 µM) accelerated lysis of platelet-fibrin clots (in PRP) dose-dependently, whereas fibrinolysis of platelet-free clots was slightly inhibited by ≥ 1000 µM stressor. Concentrations of ONOO(-) affecting the lysis of platelet-rich clots, inhibited clot retraction (CR) in a dose-dependent manner. Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) measurements performed in PRP showed that treatment with ONOO(-) (threshold conc. 100 µM) prolongs clotting time, and reduces alpha angle, and clot formation velocity parameters indicating for reduced thrombin formation rate. In PRP, ONOO(-) (threshold conc. 100 µM) reduced the collagen-evoked exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on platelets' plasma membrane, the shedding of platelet-derived microparticles (PMP), and inhibited platelet-dependent thrombin generation (measured in artificial system), dose-dependently. As judged by confocal microscopy, similar ONOO(-) concentrations altered the architecture of clots formed in collagen-treated PRP. Clots formed in the presence of ONOO(-) were less dense and were composed of thicker fibers, which make them more susceptible to lysis. In platelet-depleted plasma, ONOO(-) (up to milimolar concentration) did not alter clot structure. Blockage of PS exposed on platelets resulted in an alteration of clot architecture toward more prone to lysis. ONOO(-), at lysis-affecting concentrations, inhibited the collagen-evoked secretion of fibrinolytic inhibitors from platelets. We conclude that physiologically relevant ONOO(-) concentrations may accelerate the lysis of platelet-fibrin clots predominantly via downregulation of platelet-related mechanisms including: platelet secretion, clot retraction, platelet procoagulant response, and the alteration in clot architecture associated with it.",2015,"['Misztal, Tomasz', 'Rusak, Tomasz', 'Brańska-Januszewska, Justyna', 'Ostrowska, Halina', 'Tomasiak, Marian']"
Zinc delays clot lysis by attenuating plasminogen activation and plasmin-mediated fibrin degradation.,"Zinc circulates free in plasma at a concentration of 0.1-2 µM, but its levels increase locally when it is released from activated platelets. Although zinc influences many processes in haemostasis, its effect on fibrinolysis has not been thoroughly investigated. Using a fluorescent zinc-binding probe, we demonstrated that zinc binds tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasmin with high affinity (Kd values of 0.2 µM), and surface plasmon resonance studies revealed that zinc binds fibrin with a Kd of 12.8 µM. Zinc had no effect on the affinity of plasminogen or plasmin for fibrin, but increased the affinity of tPA by two-fold. In the presence of 5 µM zinc, the catalytic efficiency of plasminogen activation by tPA was reduced by approximately two-fold, both in the absence or presence of fibrin. Zinc attenuated plasmin-mediated degradation of the fibrinogen alpha-chain by 43 %, but had no effect on trypsin degradation. tPA-mediated fibrin clot lysis was prolonged 2.5-fold by zinc in a concentration-dependent fashion, and tPA-mediated plasma clot lysis was attenuated by 1.5-fold. Therefore, our data indicate that zinc modulates fibrinolysis by attenuating tPA-mediated plasminogen activation and plasmin-induced fibrin degradation. These findings suggest that local release of zinc by platelets attenuates fibrinolysis.",2015,"['Henderson, Sara J', 'Stafford, Alan R', 'Leslie, Beverly A', 'Kim, Paul Y', 'Vaezzadeh, Nima', 'Ni, Ran', 'Fredenburgh, James C', 'Weitz, Jeffrey I']"
Prediction of recurrent venous thromboembolism by clot lysis time: a prospective cohort study.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a chronic disease, which tends to recur. Whether an abnormal fibrinolytic system is associated with an increased risk of VTE is unclear. We assessed the relationship between fibrinolytic capacity (reflected by clot lysis time [CLT]) and risk of recurrent VTE. We followed 704 patients (378 women; mean age 48 yrs) with a first unprovoked VTE for an average of 46 months after anticoagulation withdrawal. Patients with natural coagulation inhibitor deficiency, lupus anticoagulant, cancer, homozygosity for factor V Leiden or prothrombin mutation, or requirement for indefinite anticoagulation were excluded. Study endpoint was symptomatic recurrent VTE. For measurement of CLT, a tissue factor-induced clot was lysed by adding tissue-type plasminogen activator. Time between clot formation and lysis was determined by measuring the turbidity. 135 (19%) patients had recurrent VTE. For each increase in CLT of 10 minutes, the crude relative risk (RR) of recurrence was 1.13 (95% CI 1.02-1.25; p = 0.02) and was 1.08 (95% CI 0.98-1.20; p = 0.13) after adjustment for age and sex. For women only, the adjusted RR was 1.14 (95% CI, 0.91-1.42, p = 0.22) for each increase in CLT of 10 minutes. CLT values in the 4(th) quartile of the female patient population, as compared to values in the 1(st) quartile, conferred a risk of recurrence of 3.28 (95% CI, 1.07-10.05; p = 0.04). No association between CLT and recurrence risk was found in men. Hypofibrinolysis as assessed by CLT confers a moderate increase in the risk of recurrent VTE. A weak association between CLT and risk of recurrence was found in women only.",2012,"['Traby, Ludwig', 'Kollars, Marietta', 'Eischer, Lisbeth', 'Eichinger, Sabine', 'Kyrle, Paul A']"
Development of an in vitro model to study clot lysis activity of thrombolytic drugs.,"Thrombolytic drugs are widely used for the management of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis patients. Several in vitro models have been developed to study clot lytic activity of thrombolytic drugs, but all of these have certain limitations. There is need of an appropriate model to check the clot lytic efficacy of thrombolytic drugs. In the present study, an attempt has been made to design and develop a new model system to study clot lysis in a simplified and easy way using a thrombolytic drug, streptokinase. Whole blood from healthy individuals (n = 20) was allowed to form clots in a pre-weighed sterile microcentrifuge tubes; serum was removed and clot was weighed. After lysis by streptokinase fluid was removed and remnants of clot were again weighed along with the tube. Percentage of Clot lysis was calculated on the basis of the weight difference of microcentrifuge tubes obtained before and after clot lysis. There was a significant percentage of clot lysis observed when streptokinase was used. On the other hand with water (negative control), minimal (2.5%) clot lysis was observed. There was a significant difference between clot lysis done by streptokinase and water.",2006,"['Prasad, Sweta', 'Kashyap, Rajpal S', 'Deopujari, Jayant Y', 'Purohit, Hemant J', 'Taori, Girdhar M', 'Daginawala, Hatim F']"
Biological variation in tPA-induced plasma clot lysis time.,"Hypofibrinolysis is a risk factor for venous and arterial thrombosis, and can be assessed by using a turbidimetric tPA-induced clot lysis time (CLT) assay. Biological variation in clot lysis time may affect the interpretation and usefulness of CLT as a risk factor for thrombosis. Sufficient information about assay variation and biological variation in CLT is not yet available. Thus, this study aimed to determine the analytical, within-subject and between-subject variation in CLT. We collected blood samples from 40 healthy individuals throughout a period of one year (average 11.8 visits) and determined the CLT of each plasma sample in duplicate. The mean (± SD) CLT was 83.8 (± 11.1) minutes. The coefficients of variation for total variation, analytical variation, within-subject variation and between-subject variation were 13.4%, 2.6%, 8.2% and 10.2%, respectively. One measurement can estimate the CLT that does not deviate more than 20% from its true value. The contribution of analytical variation to the within-subject variation was 5.0%, the index of individuality was 0.84 and the reference change value was 23.8%. The CLT was longer in the morning compared to the afternoon and was slightly longer in older individuals (> 40 years) compared to younger (≤40 years) individuals. There was no seasonal variation in CLT and no association with air pollution. CLT correlated weakly with fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, prothrombin time and thrombin generation. This study provides insight into the biological variation of CLT, which can be used in future studies testing CLT as a potential risk factor for thrombosis.",2012,"['Talens, Simone', 'Malfliet, Joyce J M C', 'Rudež, Goran', 'Spronk, Henri M H', 'Janssen, Nicole A H', 'Meijer, Piet', 'Kluft, Cornelis', 'de Maat, Moniek P M', 'Rijken, Dingeman C']"
Fibrinolytic enzyme production by newly isolated Bacillus cereus SRM-001 with enhanced in-vitro blood clot lysis potential.,"The discovery of plasmin-like microbial fibrinolytic enzymes having high specificity and negligible side effects is crucial for thrombolytic therapy. Herein, we report one such extra-cellular fibrinolytic enzyme producing Bacillus cereus SRM-001 isolated from the blood-laden soil of a chicken dump yard. The potency of the enzyme was established with fibrin plate assay and in-vitro blood clot lysis assay. The shake-flask operating parameters and media composition were optimized for maximizing the productivity of the enzyme. The operating parameters, pH 7, 37°C, 1% inoculum volume and 24 h inoculum age, were found to be the optimum. The levels of media components, corn flour (0.3% w/v), soyabean powder (1.9% w/v) and MnSO4 (11.5 mM) were optimized by statistical analysis using Box-Behnken design derived RSM. This resulted in an almost 1.8 fold increase in fibrinolytic enzyme productivity. The 3D response surface plots showed soyabean powder and MnSO4 to be the key ingredients for enhancing the enzyme productivity, whereas corn flour had a marginal effect. The in-vitro blood clot lysis assay conducted at near physiological pH 7 at 37°C showed the enzyme to be a potential therapeutic thrombolytic agent.",2015,"['Narasimhan, Manoj Kumar', 'Chandrasekaran, Muthukumaran', 'Rajesh, Mathur']"
Effect of aminocaproic acid on clot strength and clot lysis of canine blood determined by use of an in vitro model of hyperfibrinolysis.,"OBJECTIVE To determine pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles of aminocaproic acid (ACA) by use of a thromboelastography (TEG)-based in vitro model of hyperfibrinolysis and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. ANIMALS 5 healthy adult dogs. PROCEDURES A single dose of injectable ACA (20, 50, or 100 mg/kg) or an ACA tablet (approximately 100 mg/kg) was administered orally. Blood samples were collected at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 240 minutes after ACA administration for pharmacokinetic analysis. Samples were obtained at 0, 60, and 240 minutes for pharmacodynamic analysis by use of a TEG model of hyperfibrinolysis. RESULTS No adverse effects were detected. In the hyperfibrinolysis model, after all doses, a significantly higher TEG maximum amplitude (clot strength), compared with baseline, was detected at 60 and 240 minutes. Additionally, the percentage of fibrinolysis was reduced from the baseline value at 60 and 240 minutes, with the greatest reduction at 60 minutes. At 240 minutes, there was significantly less fibrinolysis for the 100 mg/kg dose than the 20 mg/kg dose. Maximum plasma ACA concentration was dose dependent. There was no significant difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between 100 mg/kg formulations. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE In an in vitro model of hyperfibrinolysis, ACA inhibited fibrinolysis at all doses tested. At 240 minutes after administration, the 100 mg/kg dose inhibited fibrinolysis more effectively than did the 20 mg/kg dose. Thus, ACA may be useful for in vivo prevention of fibrinolysis in dogs.

"A multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase III study of Clot Lysis Evaluation of Accelerated Resolution of Intraventricular Hemorrhage (CLEAR III).","In adults, intraventricular thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) facilitates resolution of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), reduces intracranial pressure, decreases duration of cerebrospinal fluid diversion, and may ameliorate direct neural injury. We hypothesize that patients with small parenchymal haematoma volumes (<30 cc) and relatively large IVH causing acute obstructive hydrocephalus would have improved clinical outcomes when given injections of low-dose rtPA to accelerate lysis and evacuation of IVH compared with placebo. The Clot Lysis Evaluation of Accelerated Resolution of Intraventricular Hemorrhage III trial is an investigator-initiated, phase III, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing the use of external ventricular drainage (EVD) combined with intraventricular injection of rtPA to EVD plus intraventricular injection of normal saline (placebo) for the treatment of IVH. Patients with known symptom onset within 24 h of the computed tomography scan confirmed IVH and third or fourth ventricle obstruction, with or without supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage volume <30 cc, who require EVD are screened with a computed tomography scan at least six hours after EVD placement and, if necessary, at consecutive 12-h intervals until stabilization of any intracranial bleeding has been established. Patients who meet clinical and imaging criteria (no ongoing coagulopathy and no suspicion of aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, or any other vascular anomaly) will be randomized to either intraventricular rtPA or placebo.",2014,Error Retrieving
A history of early stent thrombosis is associated with prolonged clot lysis time.,"It has been demonstrated that formation of compact plasma fibrin clots resistant to plasmin-mediated lysis characterises patients following in-stent thrombosis (IST). The relationship between defective fibrinolysis, reflected as prolonged clot lysis time (CLT) and IST is unclear. We sought to investigate whether patients with acute and subacute IST have impaired fibrinolytic capacity. We studied 41 definite IST patients, including 15 with acute and 26 with subacute IST experienced 2-73 months prior to enrollment, versus 41 controls matched for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, concomitant treatment and angiographic/stent parameters. CLT, reflecting lysis of a tissue factor-induced plasma clot by exogenous tissue plasminogen activator, together with plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen and activity, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) antigen and activity, thrombomodulin (TM), plasminogen and α2-antiplasmin (α2AP) were measured. There were no inter-group differences in angiographic parameters, indication to the first PCI, culprit vessel or a type of stent. Patients with IST had 11% longer CLT (p=0.005) and 13% higher PAI-1 antigen (p=0.04) compared to controls. There were positive correlations in both groups between CLT and PAI-1 antigen and TAFI activity (all p<0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that CLT (odds ratio [OR]=1.04 per 1 minute, 95% CI 1.01-1.08, p=0.02) and platelet count (OR=1.01 per 1,000/μl, 95% CI 1.00-1.02, p=0.034) were independent predictors of IST (R(2)=0.28, p<0.05). Concluding, impaired fibrinolytic potential, that is in part determined by plasma PAI-1 antigen and TAFI activity, characterises patients with a history of acute and subacute IST, which might help identify patients at higher risk of IST.",2012,"['Pankiw-Bembenek, Oksana', 'Zalewski, Jaroslaw', 'Goralczyk, Tadeusz', 'Undas, Anetta']"
Aβ delays fibrin clot lysis by altering fibrin structure and attenuating plasminogen binding to fibrin.,"Alzheimer disease is characterized by the presence of increased levels of the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) in the brain parenchyma and cerebral blood vessels. This accumulated Aβ can bind to fibrin(ogen) and render fibrin clots more resistant to degradation. Here, we demonstrate that Aβ(42) specifically binds to fibrin and induces a tighter fibrin network characterized by thinner fibers and increased resistance to lysis. However, Aβ(42)-induced structural changes cannot be the sole mechanism of delayed lysis because Aβ overlaid on normal preformed clots also binds to fibrin and delays lysis without altering clot structure. In this regard, we show that Aβ interferes with the binding of plasminogen to fibrin, which could impair plasmin generation and fibrin degradation. Indeed, plasmin generation by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), but not streptokinase, is slowed in fibrin clots containing Aβ(42), and clot lysis by plasmin, but not trypsin, is delayed. Notably, plasmin and tPA activities, as well as tPA-dependent generation of plasmin in solution, are not decreased in the presence of Aβ(42). Our results indicate the existence of 2 mechanisms of Aβ(42) involvement in delayed fibrinolysis: (1) through the induction of a tighter fibrin network composed of thinner fibers, and (2) through inhibition of plasmin(ogen)-fibrin binding.",2012,"['Zamolodchikov, Daria', 'Strickland, Sidney']"
Clot Lysis and Antimitotic Study of Ficus glomerata Roxb Fruit Extracts.,"The present study was carried out to investigate the thrombolytic and antimitotic potentiality of various extracts of fruits of Ficus glomerata, a traditional medicinal plant, using an in vitro assay method. Three crude extracts such as petroleum ether (FGPE), chloroform (FGCE), and methanol (FGME) were used for the study, with a standard (streptokinase) and negative control (sterile distilled water) to validate the method. The thrombolytic nature of the plant was found significant with methanol extract and chloroform and petroleum ether extracts have recorded mild activity, when compared with the negative control (sterile distilled water). The extracts have shown mild clot lysis, that is, 2.16%, 23.06%, 27.60%, and 47.74% of sterile distilled water, FGPE, FGCE, and FGME, respectively, while the standard (streptokinase) has shown 74.22% clot lysis. FGME inhibited the root growth in number as well as length effectively, followed by FGPE, while FGCE exhibited moderate antimitotic activity and it was supported by mitotic index. Therefore, the obtained results suggest that among all the extracts of plant the methanolic extract has shown highest thrombolytic and antimitotic activity.",2014,"['Shivasharanappa, Kirankumar', 'Londonkar, Ramesh']"
"Heritability of clot formation, morphology, and lysis: the EuroCLOT study.","The relative balance between clot formation and fibrinolysis is considered to reflect thrombotic potential following vascular injury. The aims of the present study were to (1) to determine the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to variance in measures of clot structure/function in the Leeds Family Study, and (2) to determine the relationship between measures of clot structure/function and cardiovascular risk. Using high throughput turbidimetric assays, heritabilities of measures of clot formation, clot structure, and clot lysis were approximately 0.30. Fibrinogen contributed to variance in all measures and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 to variance in lysis variables. Subjects at increased cardiovascular risk due to the presence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) had increased clot density (MaxAbs(C): 0.358 [0.340, 0.375]au) and prolonged lysis times (Lys(T): 510 [6569, 7939]s) compared with those without MetS (MaxAbs(C): 0.319 [0.310, 0.328]au, P=0.003; Lys(T): 7221 [4884, 5328]s, P<0.001).

Altered fibrin clot structure/function in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome: association with thrombotic manifestation.,"We tested the hypothesis that plasma fibrin clot structure/function is unfavourably altered in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Ex vivo plasma clot permeability, turbidity and susceptibility to lysis were determined in 126 consecutive patients with APS enrolled five months or more since thrombotic event vs 105 controls. Patients with both primary and secondary APS were characterised by 11% lower clot permeability (p<0.001), 4.8% shorter lag phase (p<0.001), 10% longer clot lysis time (p<0.001), and 4.7% higher maximum level of D-dimer released from clots (p=0.02) as compared to the controls. Scanning electron microscopy images confirmed denser fibrin networks composed of thinner fibres in APS. Clots from patients with ""triple-antibody positivity"" were formed after shorter lag phase (p=0.019) and were lysed at a slower rate (p=0.004) than in the remainder. Clots from APS patients who experienced stroke and/or myocardial infarction were 8% less permeable (p=0.01) and susceptible to lysis (10.4% longer clot lysis time [p=0.006] and 4.5% slower release of D-dimer from clots [p=0.01]) compared with those following venous thromboembolism alone. Multivariate analysis adjusted for potential confounders showed that in APS patients, lupus anticoagulant and ""triple-positivity"" were the independent predictors of clot permeability, while ""triple-positivity"" predicted lysis time. We conclude that APS is associated with prothrombotic plasma fibrin clot phenotype, with more pronounced abnormalities in arterial thrombosis. Molecular background for this novel prothrombotic mechanism in APS remains to be established.",2014,"['Celińska-Lowenhoff, M', 'Iwaniec, T', 'Padjas, A', 'Musiał, J', 'Undas, A']"
Fibrin clot structure in patients with congenital dysfibrinogenaemia.,"The clinical phenotype of patients with congenital dysfibrinogenaemia is highly heterogeneous, from absence of symptoms to mild bleeding, or thrombosis. A few mutations are associated with a specific phenotype, but generally the clinical course is not predictable. We investigated whether fibrin clot properties are correlated with the patient's phenotype and/or genotype. Ex vivo plasma fibrin clot characteristics, including turbidity, fibrinolysis, clot permeability and fibrin fibre density assessed by laser scanner confocal microscopy were investigated in 24 genotyped patients with congenital dysfibrinogenaemia compared to normal pool plasma. Compared to normal pool plasma, the patients were characterised by slower fibrin polymerisation (lag time, 345.10 ± 22.98 vs. 166.00s), thinner fibrin fibres (maximum absorbance, 0.15 ± 0.01 vs. 0.31), prolonged clot lysis time (23.72 ± 0.97 vs. 20.32 min) and larger clot pore size (21.5×10(-9) ± 4.48×10(-9) vs. 7.96×10(-9)cm(2)). Laser scanning confocal microscopy images confirmed disorganised fibrin networks in all patients. Patients with tendency to bleed showed an increased permeability compared to asymptomatic patients (p=0.01) and to patients with a thrombotic history (p=0.02) while patients with thrombotic history had a tendency to have a prolonged clot lysis time. Fibrin clot properties were similar among hotspot mutations. Further studies including a larger number of patients are needed to evaluate whether analysis of permeability and clot lysis time may help to distinguish the clinical phenotype in these patients and to assess differences according to the genotype.",2016,"['Casini, A', 'Duval, C', 'Pan, X', 'Tintillier, V', 'Biron-Andreani, C', 'Ariëns, R A S']"
Homocysteine influences blood clot properties alone and in combination with total fibrinogen but not with fibrinogen γ' in Africans.,"Simultaneously increased fibrinogen and homocysteine (Hcy) in blood are believed to elevate the risk of cardiovascular disease mortality. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms involved are unknown. We sought to determine whether Hcy or its genetic determinants influence blood clot properties alone or in combination with fibrinogen. In addition, we investigated, for the first time, the gamma prime (γ') isoform of fibrinogen with Hcy in relation to clot architecture and lysis. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms, Hcy and hemostatic variables, including clot lysis, determined with a global fibrinolytic assay [giving lag time, slope, maximum absorbance and clot lysis time (CLT)], were measured in 1867 healthy black South Africans and cross-sectionally analyzed. Increasing Hcy did not affect fiber cross-sectional area (maximum absorbance). However, it decreased the time needed to initiate the coagulation cascade and for fibrin fibers to grow (lag time), it increased the tempo of lateral aggregation (slope) and reduced CLT. None of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms measured had effects on clot properties. Combined effects were observed between Hcy and total fibrinogen in predicting CLT. Fibrinogen γ', which affected markers of the fibrinolytic assay, did not have conjoint effects with Hcy. We believe that there is value in recognizing the combined effects of Hcy and fibrinogen, but not its γ' isoform in relation to clot structure and lysis. The enhanced fibrinolysis rate observed in patients with low fibrinogen and high Hcy may have adverse consequences for health if it disturbs hemostasis and results in a bleeding tendency.",2015,"['Nienaber-Rousseau, Cornelie', 'de Lange, Zelda', 'Pieters, Marlien']"
In-vitro clot lytic potential of Fagonia arabica: a comparative study of two methods.,"The tube method developed in our laboratory is a simple, inexpensive and a classical whole blood clot lytic procedure through which clot lytic potential of Fagonia arabica was found to be significant. Microtiter plate clot lysis (MPCL) assay is a rapid and precise turbidimetric clot lysis method which includes measurements of maximum absorbance (Max Abs), area under the curve (AUC) along with the standard clot lysis time. In the present study we have compared and validated clot lytic potential of F. arabica extract by tube method and MPCL assay. Percentage of clot lysis was calculated by measuring the difference of the absorbance taken at 0 and 240 min in the case of MPCL assay, whereas with the tube method according to the weight difference. Fagonia arabica (50 ug/ml) was capable of clot lysis by MPCL assay and showed clot lysis pattern similar to 60 U/ml streptokinase (positive control). The clot lysis times were significantly different from one another (P value ≤0.001). When Max Abs and AUC were compared to the clot lysis time the correlation coefficient (r value) was significant too (P value ≤0.001). Moreover, we have also found that both the methods showed almost the same clot lysis percentage by streptokinase as well as F. arabica. The correlation coefficient between streptokinase, and F. arabica done by tube method and MPCL assay was found to be statistically significant (P < 0.05).

In vitro simulation of therapeutic thrombolysis with microtiter plate clot-lysis assay.,"Only limited comparable data are available on the clot lysis power of the clinically used plasminogen activators (PA). Here the PA were used at different clinically relevant concentrations, and the lysis of the microclots was determined. A microclot lysis assay was used to study thrombolysis by urokinase, tissue-PA (t-PA), streptokinase, plasminogen-streptokinase activator complex (PSAC), reteplase, or tenecteplase. The clot turbidity served as a tool to determine clot mass: 100 microL fresh microclots were incubated with 25 microL PA in 6% bovine serum albumin (BSA)-phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 100 microL BSA-PBS or pooled normal human plasma; that is, the PA were in the liquid supernatant of a plasma clot and were not entrapped in the clot, an assay system comparable to normal physiology. The turbidity was determined after 0 to 5 hours (37 degrees C) by a microtiter plate reader. The lysable clot turbidity (clot mass) was expressed in percent of 100% lysable clot control. The clot lysis activity is 100% minus the clot mass in percent. The effective doses at 50% (ED(50)) of lysis of fresh clots after 4 hours (37 degrees C) with 6% BSA or pooled normal human plasma in the clot-supernatant were urokinase 128 or 180 IU/mL; t-PA 0.3 or 0.2 microg/mL; streptokinase 215 or 1371 IU/mL; PSAC 60 or 91 U/mL; reteplase 664 or 996 U/mL; tenecteplase 0.2 or 0.2 microg/mL. The presence of a plasma thrombus with plasma supernatant increases the activity of t-PA approximately 20-fold and that of tenecteplase approximately 400-fold after 4 hours (37 degrees C), when compared to urokinase; in contrast, the lytic activity induced by reteplase decreases; i.e., the plasmin generated by reteplase is hampered on its lytic action against a thrombus. When comparing the clot lysability of microclots of 29 different donors, the only correlation (r > 0.6) was that between u-PA and t-PA. The lysability of individual clots by PA can be measured with the present routine-suited technique. It is suggested that different thrombolytic agents or concentrations thereof would have a different clinical outcome in different individuals.",2006,"['Stief', 'Thomas W']"
A novel clot lysis assay for recombinant plasminogen activator.,"Recombinant plasminogen activator (r-PA, reteplase) is an engineered variant of alteplase. When expressed in E. coli, it appears as inclusion bodies that require refolding to recover its biological activity. An important step following refolding is to determine the activity of refolded protein. Current methods for enzymatic activity of thrombolytic drugs are costly and complex. Here a straightforward and low-cost clot lysis assay was developed. It quantitatively measures the activity of the commercial reteplase and is also capable of screening refolding conditions. As evidence for adequate accuracy and sensitivity of the current assay, r-PA activity measurements are shown to be comparable to those obtained from chromogenic substrate assay.",2015,"['Jamialahmadi, Oveis', 'Fazeli, Ahmad', 'Hashemi-Najafabadi, Sameereh', 'Fazeli, Mohammad Reza']"

Ninety-five patients with MBDs of unknown origin and 98 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were investigated. Furthermore, data of 25 patients with a deficiency of factor VIII were analyzed. Plasma clot characteristics in the absence and presence of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) represented by the lag phase, rate of protofibril formation (Vmax), fibrin structure (ΔAbs), time to peak (TTP), half lysis time (t50 and area under the curve (AUC) were measured in turbidometric clot formation and lysis assays. In the fibrinolysis assay, Vmax was lower in patients than in healthy controls. No differences in the other parameters of clot formation and lysis were detected between the groups. There was no clear association of plasma clot properties with the clinical severity of bleeding in patients with MBDs. Patients with known decreased factor VIII levels also showed a lower Vmax. Fibrinogen levels were positively associated with each of the assessed parameters in both groups, with the strongest association with ΔAbs, indicating altered fibrin structure. Factor VIII activity correlated with altered clot characteristics similar to fibrinogen, especially in patients, with the strongest positive correlation to Vmax. This cohort of patients with MBDs of unknown origin showed a lower rate of fibrin formation in the fibrinolysis assay, but otherwise similar plasma clot properties compared to healthy controls.",2015,"['Gebhart, J', 'Laczkovics, C', 'Posch, F', 'Ay, C', 'Reitter-Pfoertner, S E', 'Haslacher, H', 'Muszbek, L', 'Wolberg, A S', 'Pabinger, I']"
Bleeding and infection with external ventricular drainage: a systematic review in comparison with adjudicated adverse events in the ongoing Clot Lysis Evaluating Accelerated Resolution of Intraventricular Hemorrhage Phase III (CLEAR-III IHV) trial.,"Retrospective series report varied rates of bleeding and infection with external ventricular drainage (EVD). There have been no prospective studies of these risks with systematic surveillance, threshold definitions, or independent adjudication. To analyze the rate of complications in the ongoing Clot Lysis: Evaluating Accelerated Resolution of Intraventricular Hemorrhage Phase III (CLEAR III) trial, providing a comparison with a systematic review of complications of EVD in the literature. Patients were prospectively enrolled in the CLEAR III trial after placement of an EVD for obstructive intraventricular hemorrhage and randomized to receive recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator or placebo. We counted any detected new hemorrhage (catheter tract hemorrhage or any other distant hemorrhage) on computed tomography scan within 30 days from the randomization. Meta-analysis of published series of EVD placement was compiled with STATA software. Growing or unstable hemorrhage was reported as a cause of exclusion from the trial in 74 of 5707 cases (1.3%) screened for CLEAR III. The first 250 patients enrolled have completed adjudication of adverse events. Forty-two subjects (16.8%) experienced ≥1 new bleeds or expansions, and 6 of 250 subjects (2.4%) suffered symptomatic hemorrhages. Eleven cases (4.4%) had culture-proven bacterial meningitis or ventriculitis.",2015,Error Retrieving
Clot lysis time and thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor in severe preeclampsia with or without associated antiphospholipid antibodies.,"We investigated clot lysis time, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor antigen (TAFI) levels and TAFI gene polymorphisms in pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia, with or without associated antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The study groups included 82 pregnant patients without antiphospholipid antibodies with severe preeclampsia (PE group) and 10 pregnant APS patients who developed severe preeclampsia (APS-PE group). Controls included 76 primary pregnant APS patients (APS group) and 89 healthy pregnant patients (NOR group) with uneventful term pregnancy and delivery. Patients in the APS-PE, APS and NOR groups were sampled during each trimester of pregnancy and at 4-6 months and 12 months after delivery. Patients in the PE group were sampled during the third trimester and after delivery. Significantly prolonged clot lysis time after delivery was found in the PE, APS-PE and APS groups compared to the NOR group. The PE and APS-PE groups had longer clot lysis time than the APS group. Levels of TAFI were found to be higher after delivery in patients of the PE and APS-PE groups compared to the APS and NOR groups. Allele distribution of the TAFI gene polymorphisms was similar among the four study groups. We conclude that increased TAFI antigen levels and impaired fibrinolysis are pathogenetic factors in preeclampsia, regardless of whether or not preeclampsia is associated with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies.",2010,"['Martínez-Zamora, M Angeles', 'Tassies, Dolors', 'Carmona, Francisco', 'Espinosa, Gerard', 'Cervera, Ricard', 'Reverter, Juan Carlos', 'Balasch, Juan']"
Cow Dung Is a Novel Feedstock for Fibrinolytic Enzyme Production from Newly Isolated Bacillus sp. IND7 and Its Application in In Vitro Clot Lysis.,"Bacterial fibrinolytic enzymes find great applications to treat and prevent cardiovascular diseases. The novel fibrinolytic enzymes from food grade organisms are useful for thrombolytic therapy. This study reports fibrinolytic enzyme production by Bacillus sp. IND7 in solid-state fermentation (SSF). In this study, cow dung was used as the cheap substrate for the production of fibrinolytic enzyme. Enzyme production was primarily improved by optimizing the nutrient and physical factors by one-variable-at-a-time approach. A statistical method (two-level full factorial design) was applied to investigate the significant variables. Of the different variables, pH, starch, and beef extract significantly influenced on the production of fibrinolytic enzyme (p < 0.05). The optimum levels of these significant factors were further investigated using response surface methodology. The optimum conditions for enhanced fibrinolytic enzyme production were 1.23% (w/w) starch and 0.3% (w/w) beef extract with initial medium pH 9.0. Under the optimized conditions, cow dung substrate yielded 8,345 U/g substrate, and an overall 2.5-fold improvement in fibrinolytic enzyme production was achieved due to its optimization. This is the first report of fibrinolytic enzyme production using cow dung substrate from Bacillus sp. in SSF. The crude enzyme displayed potent activity on zymography and digested goat blood clot completely in in vitro condition.",2016,"['Vijayaraghavan, Ponnuswamy', 'Arun, Arumugaperumal', 'Vincent, Samuel Gnana Prakash', 'Arasu, Mariadhas Valan', 'Al-Dhabi, Naif Abdullah']"
"Lipoprotein (a), LPA Ile4399Met, and fibrin clot properties.","Elevated lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) levels were reported to be associated with dense fibrin clots. The apo(a) component of Lp(a) is encoded by LPA, and the Met allele of the LPA Ile4399Met polymorphism is associated with elevated Lp(a) levels and cardiovascular disease risk. We investigated whether Ile4399Met was associated with fibrin clot properties. We determined plasma Lp(a) levels, fibrin clot permeability and lysis time for 64 LPA 4399Met carriers and 128 noncarriers matched for age, sex, ethnicity, and enrollment site. Elevated Lp(a) levels were associated with reduced clot permeability and prolonged lysis time (P<0.0001). Carriers of 4399Met had higher Lp(a) levels compared with noncarriers (P=0.0003). However, this association differed by ethnicity (P=0.003 for interaction between genotype and ethnicity): compared with noncarriers, 4399Met carriers had 2.89 fold higher Lp(a) levels among Caucasians while no difference was observed among non-Caucasians (primarily East Asians and Hispanics). Among all subjects, no association was observed between Ile4399Met and clot properties, but this relationship also differed by ethnicity: among non-Caucasians, 4399Met carriers had increased clot permeability and shorter lysis time; whereas among Caucasians, the trend was for decreased permeability and longer lysis time (P<0.01 for interactions between genotype and ethnicity).",2014,"['Rowland, Charles M', 'Pullinger, Clive R', 'Luke, May M', 'Shiffman, Dov', 'Green, Lauri', 'Movsesyan, Irina', 'Devlin, James J', 'Malloy, Mary J', 'Kane, John P', 'Undas, Anetta']"
Vitamin K antagonists favourably modulate fibrin clot properties in patients with atrial fibrillation as early as after 3days of treatment: Relation to coagulation factors and thrombin generation.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of thromboembolism that is reduced by vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). We sought to investigate changes in plasma fibrin clot phenotype at the onset of oral anticoagulation. Forty consecutive AF patients (aged 45-83 years, CHA2DS2-VASc score 3.0±1.5) who started therapy with warfarin or acenocoumarol were studied. Plasma fibrin clot permeability (Ks), clot lysis time (CLT), along with clotting factors (F), thrombin generation (TG) profiles and protein C (PC) levels were determined on days 3, 5, 7, 28 and 56±1 since the first dose. AF patients had 16% higher median of Ks and 15% lower median of CLT as early as on day 3 of VKA therapy compared with the baseline (both p<0.001), reaching the plateau values on day 7 and 5, respectively. Higher Ks values on days 1 and 3 were found in AF patients with further stable anticoagulation (both p<0.05). Moreover, FIX explained 32% of the total variability in Ks. Multivariate analysis adjusted for potential confounders including time as a predictor showed that vitamin K-dependent (VKD) factors, PC and TG parameters were the predictors of Ks (all p<0.0001), while only the lag phase of TG and thrombin peak predicted CLT (both p<0.05) in AF patients. Regression analysis of time-series showed however, that CLT was also predicted by VKD factors and PC (all p<0.05).",2015,"['Ząbczyk, Michał', 'Majewski, Jacek', 'Karkowski, Grzegorz', 'Malinowski, Krzysztof Piotr', 'Undas, Anetta']"
Development of a new clot formation protocol for standardized in vitro investigations of sonothrombolysis.,"Agreement about the most suitable clot formation protocol for sonothrombolysis investigations is lacking. Lysis rates vary strongly owing to different test conditions and, thus, cannot be compared. We aim to establish a simple but physiologically grounded protocol for in vitro coagulation to enable standardized sonothrombolysis investigations. Clots were generated from platelet-rich plasma (PRP) obtained by centrifugation (10 min, 180 × g) of human venous blood (VB). PRP was mixed with the boundary layer formed between the supernatant and the erythrocyte layer. To achieve clots with different platelet counts, PRP was gradually substituted with platelet-free plasma (PFP), harvested from the supernatant of VB after centrifugation (10 min, 2570 × g). Clot types were examined for histological appearance, hydrodynamic resistance under physiological flows, and lysis rate measured by weight loss after a 2-h treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) (60 kU/ml). Lysis rates of the most suitable clot were measured after a 1-h treatment with rt-PA (60 kU/ml), and combined treatment with rt-PA and 2-MHz transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS) (0.179 W/cm(2)) or 2-MHz transcranial Doppler (TCD) (0.457 W/cm(2)). With increased platelet count, the hydrodynamic resistance of the artificial clots increased, their histological appearance became more physiological, and lysis rates decreased. The most suitable clots consisted of 1.5-ml PRP, 2.0-ml PFP, and 0.5-ml boundary layer. Their lysis rates were 36.7 ± 7.8% (rt-PA), 40.8 ± 8.6% (rt-PA+TCCS), and 40.4 ± 8.3% (rt-PA+TCD).

High-intensity focused ultrasound sonothrombolysis: the use of perfluorocarbon droplets to achieve clot lysis at reduced acoustic power.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate use of intravascular perfluorocarbon droplets to reduce the sonication power required to achieve clot lysis with high-intensity focused ultrasound. High-intensity focused ultrasound with droplets was initially applied to blood clots in an in vitro flow apparatus, and inertial cavitation thresholds were determined. An embolic model for ischemic stroke was used to illustrate the feasibility of this technique in vivo. Recanalization with intravascular droplets was achieved in vivo at 24 ± 5% of the sonication power without droplets. Recanalization occurred in 71% of rabbits that received 1-ms pulsed sonications during continuous intravascular droplet infusion (p = 0.041 vs controls). Preliminary experiments indicated that damage was confined to the ultrasonic focus, suggesting that tolerable treatments would be possible with a more tightly focused hemispheric array that allows the whole focus to be placed inside of the main arteries in the human brain.",2014,"['Pajek, Daniel', 'Burgess, Alison', 'Huang, Yuexi', 'Hynynen, Kullervo']"
"A long-lasting, plasmin-activatable thrombin inhibitor aids clot lysis in vitro and does not promote bleeding in vivo.","The leech protein hirudin is a potent inhibitor of thrombin, but clinical use of recombinant hirudin is restricted by haemorrhagic risks, and complicated by hirudin's rapid clearance from the circulation. We previously employed albumin fusion to slow hirudin variant 3 (HV3) clearance. In this study, we hypothesized that reconfiguration of the chimera, appending human serum albumin (HSA) to the N-terminus of HV3, with an intervening plasmin cleavage site, would create a slowly cleared, plasmin-activatable HV3. Potential plasmin cleavage sites were screened by expression in Escherichia coli, interposed between glutathione sulfotransferase and HV3 domains. The most reactive sequence (GSGIYR-ITY) was recreated in C-terminally His-tagged albumin fusion protein HSACHV3, expressed in Pichia pastoris yeast and purified by nickel-chelate affinity chromatography. HSACHV3 showed no thrombin inhibitory activity in the absence of plasmin, but liberated active HV3 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in its presence. In a discontinuous clot assay involving clot-bound thrombin, HSACHV3 assisted clot lysis by limiting clot extension in a tPA- and concentration-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained in plasma at higher concentrations of HSACHV3. The chimeric protein exhibited much slower clearance in mice than unfused HV3, and indistinguishable pharmacokinetics from unfused recombinant HSA. In a mouse tail transection bleeding model, doses of HSACHV3 identical to those of HV3 that elicited a four-fold increase in the volume of shed blood were without effect. Our results suggest that HSACHV3 is a fully latent, plasmin activatable, long-lasting hirudin, of potential benefit in thrombotic disorders resistant to natural or pharmacological clot lysis.",2009,"['Sheffield, William P', 'Eltringham-Smith, Louise J', 'Gataiance, Sharon', 'Bhakta, Varsha']"
Plasma homocysteine affects fibrin clot permeability and resistance to lysis in human subjects.,"Homocysteine (Hcy) is a risk factor for thrombosis. We investigated a hypothesis that the clot permeability and its resistance to fibrinolysis is associated with plasma total Hcy (tHcy) in human subjects. We studied healthy men not taking any medication (n=76), male patients with advanced coronary artery disease (CAD) taking low-dose aspirin (n=33), men with diabetes mellitus diagnosed recently (median hemoglobin A(1c) 7.65%; n=16), and patients with isolated hypercholesterolemia (>7.0 mmol/L; n=15). We assessed clot permeability and turbidimetric lysis time as the determinants of fibrin clot structure. In a regression model, including age and fibrinogen, plasma tHcy was an independent predictor of clot permeation and fibrinolysis time in healthy subjects (R2=0.88, P<0.0001 and R2=0.54, P<0.0001, respectively). In CAD patients, tHcy and fibrinogen were stronger predictors of the permeation coefficient (R2=0.84; P<0.0001) than was fibrinogen alone (R2=0.66; P<0.0001), whereas tHcy was the only predictor of lysis time (R2=0.69; P<0.0001). Elevated tHcy levels observed after methionine load were not associated with any of the fibrin clot properties. In patients with diabetes or hypercholesterolemia, the influence of Hcy on permeation and, to a lesser extent, on the lysis time was obscured by dominant effects of glucose and cholesterol. In 20 asymptomatic men with hyperhomocysteinemia treated with folic acid, reduction in tHcy levels resulted in increased clot permeability (P=0.0002) and shorter lysis time (P<0.0001).",2006,"['Undas, Anetta', 'Brozek, Jan', 'Jankowski, Milosz', 'Siudak, Zbigniew', 'Szczeklik, Andrew', 'Jakubowski, Hieronim']"

Singlet oxygen enhances intrinsic thrombolysis: the intrinsic oxidative clot lysis assay (INOXCLA).,"Granulocytes are important cells of inflammation and cellular thrombolysis. They produce urokinase (u-PA) and chloramines. In this study, u-PA/chloramine-mediated fibrinolysis is imitated in a microtiter-plate. Seventy-five microliters plasma are incubated with 50 microL 50% Pathromtin SL, 6% BSA, and 38 mM CaCl2 for 30 minutes (37 degrees C). Then, 50 microL 10 mM chloramine-T in PBS are added. After 30 minutes (37 degrees C), 50 microL 0, 100, or 10 IU/mL u-PA in 6% BSA-PBS are added and the turbidity is determined at 405 nm after 0, 3, or 16 hours. Clot lysis was increased more than tenfold by 0.5 to 1 micromoles chloramine (ED50 after 3h = about 0.25 micromoles = 2 mM final concentration). The normal range for the present intrinsic oxidative clot lysis assay (INOXCLA) is 100% +/- 25% (MV +/- SD; 100 relative % of norm; the normal lysis being 60 absolute %; CVs < 10%). Fifty percent lysis of adherent microclots occurred after 0.75 hours, 2 hours, 14 hours, 13 days, or 17 days when using 1000, 100, 10, 1, or 0 IU/mL u-PA reagent. If the u-PA activity is quenched by PAI-2, no clot lysis appears. Chloramines are important physiologic generators of nonradical excited singlet oxygen and enhance u-PA-mediated lysis of plasma clots. Based on the u-PA/chloramines coaction, a new global fibrinolysis assay has been derived.",2007,"['Stief', 'Thomas W']"
Plasma clot lysis time and its association with cardiovascular risk factors in black Africans.,"Studies in populations of European descent show longer plasma clot lysis times (CLT) in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) than in controls. No data are available on the association between CVD risk factors and fibrinolytic potential in black Africans, a group undergoing rapid urbanisation with increased CVD prevalence. We investigated associations between known CVD risk factors and CLT in black Africans and whether CLTs differ between rural and urban participants in light of differences in CVD risk.Data from 1000 rural and 1000 urban apparently healthy black South Africans (35-60 years) were cross-sectionally analysed.Increased PAI-1(act), BMI, HbA1c, triglycerides, the metabolic syndrome, fibrinogen concentration, CRP, female sex and positive HIV status were associated with increased CLTs, while habitual alcohol consumption associated with decreased CLT. No differences in CLT were found between age and smoking categories, contraceptive use or hyper- and normotensive participants. Urban women had longer CLT than rural women while no differences were observed for men.CLT was associated with many known CVD risk factors in black Africans. Differences were however observed, compared to data from populations of European descent available in the literature, suggesting possible ethnic differences. The effect of urbanisation on CLT is influenced by traditional CVD risk factors and their prevalence in urban and rural communities.",2012,"['de Lange, Zelda', 'Pieters, Marlien', 'Jerling, Johann C', 'Kruger, Annamarie', 'Rijken, Dingeman C']"
Clot lysis time and the risk of myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke in young women; results from the RATIO case-control study.,"Reduced overall fibrinolytic capacity increases the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), as demonstrated in studies with predominantly male participants. We determined the influence of altered fibrinolysis on the risk of MI and ischaemic stroke (IS) in young women. The RATIO (Risk of Arterial Thrombosis In relation to Oral contraceptives) study is a population-based case-control study including young women with MI (n=203), IS (N=175) and 638 matched healthy controls. Fibrinolytic potential was determined with a tissue factor/tissue plasminogen activator induced clot-lysis assay. Odds ratios (OR) adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors were obtained with logistic regression. Clot-lysis time (CLT) was divided into tertiles based on the control group (T1-T3), with T2 as reference. Hypofibrinolysis (prolonged CLT) was associated with an increase in risk of MI (T3 vs. T2, OR 2·8; 95%confidence interval [CI] 1·7-4·7). Hyperfibrinolysis (decreased CLT) had no clear effect (T1 vs. T2, OR 1·6; 95% CI 0·9-2·9). Hypofibrinolysis did not affect the risk of IS (T3 vs. T2, OR 1·5; 95% CI 0·7-3·0), whereas hyperfibrinolysis increased this risk (T1 vs. T2, OR 4·1; 95% CI 2·1-8·0). Oral contraceptive use and smoking further increased these risks. Hypofibrinolysis increases the risk for MI in young women, a finding similar to previous studies. Counter-intuitively, hyperfibrinolysis increased the risk of IS four-fold, which suggests that MI and IS have different aetiologies.",2012,"['Siegerink, Bob', 'Meltzer, Mirjam E', 'de Groot, Philip G', 'Algra, Ale', 'Lisman, Ton', 'Rosendaal, Frits R']"
Reduced plasma fibrin clot permeability and susceptibility to fibrinolysis are associated with increased intima-media thickness in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome.,"Formation of denser fibrin networks displaying impaired lysability has been reported in subjects at an increased risk of atherosclerosis. Given recent data on prothrombotic fibrin clot phenotype reported in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), we tested the hypothesis that altered fibrin clot properties are associated with increased intima-media thickness (IMT) observed in PAPS. We studied 30 consecutive patients with PAPS and 30 controls matched for age, sex and the type of previous thromboembolism. We assessed plasma fibrin clot permeability (Ks) and clot lysis time (CLT) with their potential determinants. The IMT was measured in 3 segments of the carotid arteries. Patients with APS had 15.2% lower Ks (p=0.002) and 9.7% prolonged CLT (p=0.039) compared with controls. The IMT in the APS group was greater in the common carotid artery (5.7%; p=0.002), at the bifurcation (17.46%; p<0.001), and the internal artery (9.26%; p=0.015). Patients with triple positivity in the antiphospholipid antibody profile (n=9; 30%) had lower Ks and greater IMT (both, p<0.05), compared with those with single positivity (n=13; 43.3%). Multivariate analysis adjusted for potential confounders showed that in APS patients, oxidized low-density lipoproteins (p=0.019) were the only independent predictor of Ks, while thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor activity (p<0.001) predicted CLT. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) was found to be the independent predictor of the IMT in the common carotid artery (p=0.004), and in the internal carotid artery (p<0.001).",2014,"['Asztabski, Michal', 'Wypasek, Ewa', 'Ząbczyk, Michał', 'Undas, Anetta']"
"Interconnectedness of global hemostasis assay parameters in simultaneously evaluated thrombin generation, fibrin generation and clot lysis in normal plasma.","Fluorogenic thrombin generation (TG) assays and turbidity-based fibrin generation (FG)- and fibrinolysis (FL)-resistance assays have been sought to assess bleeding and clotting disorders. Theoretically, TG, FG and FL tests should provide overlapping information because thrombin is responsible for FG and induces protection from FL. The relationships between TG, FG and FL parameters remain poorly investigated, partly because existing experimental systems do not permit simultaneous detection of both TG and FG in the same sample of plasma, and are instead tested in separate experiments. We evaluated the potential benefits of a combined TG/FG/FL assay by testing responses of normal plasma to a wide range of tissue factor (TF) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) concentrations. Correlations between multiple parameters extracted from the TG and FG/FL curves were also compared. Rate of FG correlated well with TG peak height at all TF concentrations, but correlations between TG and FL parameters depended on the TF concentration. Without thrombomodulin, all FG/FL parameters at high TF could be predicted from TG parameters and no FL protection was observed. With thrombomodulin and high TF, TF-dependent FL protection did not correlate with TF-dependent TG. The fluorogenic thrombin substrate did not interfere with optical density readings, and meaningful tPA concentrations did not interfere with TG readings.",2016,"['Xin, Kevin Z', 'Chang, William C', 'Ovanesov, Mikhail V']"
The influence of type 2 diabetes on fibrin clot properties in patients with coronary artery disease.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increases the risk of coronary thrombosis and both conditions are associated with altered fibrin clot properties. However, the influence of T2DM on fibrin clot properties in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the influence of T2DM on fibrin clot properties in patients with CAD. Fibrin clot structure and fibrinolysis were investigated in 581 CAD patients (148 with T2DM) using turbidimetric assays, confocal and scanning electron microscopy. Clots made from plasma and plasma-purified fibrinogen were studied, and plasma levels of inflammatory markers were analysed. T2DM patients had increased clot maximum absorbance compared with non-diabetic patients (0.36 ± 0.1 vs 0.33 ± 0.1 au; p=0.01), displayed longer lysis time (804 [618;1002] vs 750 [624;906] seconds; p=0.03) and showed more compact fibrin structure assessed by confocal and electron microscopy. Fibrinogen levels were elevated in T2DM (p< 0.001), but clots made from purified fibrinogen showed no differences in fibrin properties in the two populations. Adjusting for fibrinogen levels, T2DM was associated with C-reactive protein and complement C3 plasma levels, with the former correlating with clot maximum absorbance (r=0.24, p< 0.0001) and the latter with lysis time (r=0.30, p< 0.0001). Independent of fibrinogen levels, females had more compact clots with prolonged lysis time compared with males (all p-values< 0.001). In conclusion, T2DM is associated with prothrombotic changes in fibrin clot properties in patients with CAD. This is related to quantitative rather than qualitative changes in fibrinogen with a possible role for inflammatory proteins.",2014,"['Neergaard-Petersen, S', 'Hvas, A-M', 'Kristensen, S D', 'Grove, E L', 'Larsen, S B', 'Phoenix, F', 'Kurdee, Z', 'Grant, P J', 'Ajjan, R A']"
Reduced clot permeability and susceptibility to lysis in patients with acute coronary syndrome: effects of inflammation and oxidative stress.,"Stable angina is associated with unfavorable fibrin structure/function. It is not known how acute coronary syndromes (ACS) affect fibrin architecture. We investigated fibrin clot properties and their determinants in ACS patients. Clot permeability, turbidity and fibrinolysis were assessed in 40 patients with ACS versus 40 controls with stable angina matched for age, sex, and risk factors. Patients with ACS had lower clot permeability (p=0.001), faster fibrin polymerization (p=0.008), and prolonged fibrinolysis time (p<0.0001) than controls. C-reactive protein (CRP) and 8-epi-prostaglandin F(2alpha), a marker of oxidative stress, were the only independent predictors of clot permeability (R(2)=-0.74; p<0.0001 and R(2)=-0.65; p<0.0001, respectively) and fibrinolysis time in ACS patients (R(2)=0.60; p<0.0001 and R(2)=0.59; p=0.0002, respectively). In angina patients, fibrinogen and CRP predicted permeability (R(2)=-0.71; p<0.0001 and R(2)=-0.62; p<0.0001), and D-dimer predicted lysis time (R(2)=0.54; p=0.0005).

Induction therapy alters plasma fibrin clot properties in multiple myeloma patients: association with thromboembolic complications.,"Induction therapy in patients with multiple myeloma increases the risk of thromboembolism. We have recently shown that multiple myeloma patients tend to form denser fibrin clots displaying poor lysability. We investigated the effect of induction therapy on fibrin clot properties in multiple myeloma patients. Ex-vivo plasma fibrin clot permeability, turbidity, susceptibility to lysis, thrombin generation, factor VIII and fibrinolytic proteins were compared in 48 multiple myeloma patients prior to and following 3 months of induction therapy, mainly with cyclophosphamide-thalidomide-dexamethasone regimen. Patients on thromboprophylaxis with aspirin or heparins were eligible. A 3-month induction therapy resulted in improved clot properties, that is higher clot permeability, compaction, shorter lag phase and higher final turbidity, along with shorter clot lysis time and higher rate of D-dimer release from fibrin clots than the baseline values. The therapy also resulted in lower thrombin generation, antiplasmin and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), but elevated factor VIII. Progressive disease was associated with lower posttreatment clot permeability and lysability. Despite thromboprophylaxis, two patients developed ischemic stroke and 10 had venous thromboembolism. They were characterized by pretreatment lower clot permeability, prolonged clot lysis time, longer lag phase, higher peak thrombin generation, TAFI and plasminogen activator inhibitor -1. Formation of denser plasma fibrin clots with reduced lysability and increased thrombin generation at baseline could predispose to thrombotic complications during induction treatment in multiple myeloma patients. We observed improved fibrin clot properties and thrombin generation in multiple myeloma patients except those with progressive disease.",2015,"['Undas, Anetta', 'Zubkiewicz-Usnarska, Lidia', 'Helbig, Grzegorz', 'Woszczyk, Dariusz', 'Kozińska, Justyna', 'Dmoszyńska, Anna', 'Dębski, Jakub', 'Podolak-Dawidziak, Maria', 'Kuliczkowski, Kazimierz']"
Factor XIII Val34Leu polymorphism as a modulator of fibrin clot permeability and resistance to lysis in patients with severe coronary artery disease.,"A common G to T transition in codon 34 with the subsequent valine with leucine replacement in the factor (F) XIII A-subunit affects fibrin formation and stabilisation in vitro. Data on the effects of Leu34 allele on cardiovascular thromboembolic events in vivo are conflicting. We investigated whether FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism is potent enough to affect fibrin clot properties in patients with advanced coronary artery disease (CAD). We studied 113 patients, aged 62.8 +/- 6.1 years, who were scheduled for elective isolated coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG). Patients were compared with 98 healthy age-matched controls. Ex vivo fibrin clot permeability and lysis time (t5oo/o) were determined in citrated plasma. Patients scheduled for CABG had lower clot permeability (9.14 + 1.64 vs. 10.02 + 1.12 x 10(-9) cm2; p = 0.0002) and longer t50%, (8.45 +/- 1.94 vs. 7.63 +/- 1.24 min; p < 0.0001) than controls. The Leu34 carriers, i.e. 9 (8%) Leu34Leu homozygous and 23 (20%) Val34Leu heterozygous subjects, had lower permeability by 23% in the CAD group compared with 81 (72%) patients with Val34Val genotype. A similar intergroup difference was observed for t50%, which was longer in Leu34 carriers (p < 0.0001). The FXIII Leu34 allele frequency in the control group was similar as well as the impact of Leu34 allele on fibrin properties. The effect of FXIII Leu34 allele on permeability and t50%, was not affected by homocysteine, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen levels in CAD patients and controls.",2009,"['Stepień, Ewa', 'Plicner, Dariusz', 'Kapelak, Bogusław', 'Wypasek, Ewa', 'Sadowski, Jerzy', 'Undas, Anetta']"
Fibrin clot formation and fibrinolysis in patients with a history of coronary stent thrombosis.,"Coronary stent thrombosis is a devastating complication of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Multiple factors underlie the pathophysiological mechanisms of stent thrombosis. Previous studies demonstrated that patients with stent thrombosis, compared to control PCI patients, formed denser fibrin clots in vitro which were more resistant to fibrinolysis, suggesting that altered fibrin clot properties may contribute to the pathophysiology of stent thrombosis. We assessed the plasma fibrin clot formation and fibrinolysis of patients with and without stent thrombosis. Cases (patients with stent thrombosis) and matched controls (patients without stent thrombosis) were included for a matched case-control study. Matching was performed on indication and time of the index PCI (initial stent implantation) from the cases. Fibrin clot formation and fibrinolysis were assessed in vitro by turbidimetric assays, with human thrombin to initiate fibrin polymerization and tissue type plasminogen activator to initiate fibrinolysis. Lag time, maximal absorbance and clot lysis time were determined by these assays. In total, 27 cases and 27 controls were included. No significant differences were observed between cases and controls in lag time (173 vs. 162s, p=0.18), maximal absorbance (0.78 vs. 0.83, p=0.36), and clot lysis time (69 vs. 71min, p=0.78). Fibrin clot formation and fibrinolysis were not associated with stent thrombosis.",2016,"['Godschalk, Thea C', 'Konings, Joke', 'Govers-Riemslag, José W', 'Ten Berg, Jurriën M', 'Hackeng, Christian M', 'Ten Cate, Hugo']"
Altered plasma fibrin clot properties in essential thrombocythemia.,"Patients with increased thromboembolic risk tend to form denser fibrin clots which are relatively resistant to lysis. We sought to investigate whether essential thrombocythemia (ET) is associated with altered fibrin clot properties in plasma. Ex vivo plasma fibrin clot permeability coefficient (Ks), turbidimetry and clot lysis time (CLT) were measured in 43 consecutive patients with ET (platelet count from 245 to 991 × 10(3)/µL) and 50 control subjects matched for age, sex and comorbidities. Fibrinolysis proteins and inhibitors together with platelet activation markers were determined. Reduced Ks (-38%, p < 0.0001) and prolonged CLT (+34%, p < 0.0001) were observed in ET. The differences remained significant after adjustment for fibrinogen and platelet count. ET was associated with a slightly shorter lag phase (-5%, p = 0.01) and higher maximum absorbency of the turbidimetric curve (+6%, p < 0.001). The ET patients had higher plasma P-selectin by 193% (p < 0.00001) and platelet factor 4 (PF4) by 173% (p < 0.00001), with higher P-selectin observed in 19 (44%) patients with JAK-2 gene V617F mutation. Higher t-PA (+20%, p < 0.001), 23% higher plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, PAI-1 (+23%, p < 0.01) and unaltered thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, plasminogen and α2-antiplasmin activity were found in the ET group. Ks inversely correlated with fibrinogen, PF4 and C-reactive protein. CLT positively correlated only with PAI-1. Patients with ET display prothrombotic plasma fibrin clot phenotype including impaired fibrinolysis, which represents a new prothrombotic mechanism in this disease.",2016,"['Małecki, Rafał', 'Gacka, Małgorzata', 'Kuliszkiewicz-Janus, Małgorzata', 'Jakobsche-Policht, Urszula', 'Kwiatkowski, Jacek', 'Adamiec, Rajmund', 'Undas, Anetta']"
Short-term high-dose effect of lovastatin on thrombolysis by rt-PA in a human whole-blood in vitro clot model.,"High-dose hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme. A reductase inhibitor (statin) administration reduces neuronal injury and improves outcomes in experimental models of acute ischemic stroke, and has been shown to be safe in a phase 1 dose-escalation study using lovastatin at doses higher than currently approved for daily use. Statins also affect the hemostatic system by upregulating t-PA expression and decreasing plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) expression, platelet adhesion and thrombus formation in animal models. Since a thrombolytic agent, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), is currently the only FDA-approved therapy for use in ischemic stroke patients, it is important to ascertain whether high statin doses impact the efficacy of rt-PA. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of a high dose of lovastatin and its active form, lovastatin hydroxy acid, on rt-PA thrombolysis in an in vitro model. Percentage clot lysis was measured in the presence and absence of rt-PA in three different treatment groups: lovastatin, lovastatin hydroxy acid, and ethanol. The effect of ethanol on clot lysis was studied since ethanol was used to disperse the highly hydrophobic lovastatin. The decrease in clot width over time was measured using microscopic imaging of an in vitro human whole blood clot model; an approximately 400 μm diameter clot was formed on suture silk, suspended in human fresh frozen plasma (hFFP) and exposed to treatment. In the absence of rt-PA, clot lysis did not show statistically significant differences in the percentage clot lysis between different treatment groups (p=0.103). In the presence of rt-PA, clot lysis was greater than in the absence of rt-PA for all groups, but there were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups (p=0.385). In this in vitro study, high doses of lovastatin neither impaired nor enhanced the lytic efficacy of rt-PA.",2012,"['Kandadai, Madhuvanthi A', 'Meunier, Jason', 'Lindsell, Christopher J', 'Shaw, George J', 'Elkind, Mitchell S V']"
The biochemical and physical process of fibrinolysis and effects of clot structure and stability on the lysis rate.,"The effectiveness of fibrinolysis results from the combination of regulated enzymatic activity and the physical properties of the fibrin scaffold. Physiologically, clots or thrombi are dissolved from within via internal lysis. In contrast, with therapeutic thrombolysis, lytic agents are introduced at one surface and lysis proceeds across the thrombus. In the latter case, there are complex changes that take place at the lysis front in a narrow zone. However, at the microscopic level the mechanisms for either general type of fibrinolysis appear to be similar. Fibrinolysis proceeds by fibers being transected laterally, rather than digestion of fibers by surface erosion from the outside. A molecular model to account for these observations together with what is known from the biochemical characterization of fibrinolysis involves the movement of plasmin laterally across fibers, binding to sites created by its own proteolytic activity. Fibrin clots can have a great diversity of structural, biological, physical, and chemical properties depending on the conditions of formation, and the rate and nature of fibrinolysis is related to these properties. In general, the rate of lysis appears to be faster for clots made up of thicker fibers than for clots made up of thinner fibers, but the lysis rate is not simply a function of fiber diameter and also depends on other physical properties of the clot. Platelet aggregation and clot retraction have a dramatic effect on the structure of fibrin and hence on fibrinolysis.",2008,"['Weisel, J W', 'Litvinov, R I']"
Abnormal plasma clot structure and stability distinguish bleeding risk in patients with severe factor XI deficiency.,"Factor XI (FXI) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. Many patients with even very low FXI levels (< 20 IU dL(-1) ) are asymptomatic or exhibit only mild bleeding, whereas others experience severe bleeding, usually following trauma. Neither FXI antigen nor activity predicts the risk of bleeding in FXI-deficient patients. (i) Characterize the formation, structure and stability of plasma clots from patients with severe FXI deficiency and (ii) determine whether these assays can distinguish asymptomatic patients ('non-bleeders') from those with a history of bleeding ('bleeders'). Platelet-poor plasmas were prepared from 16 severe FXI-deficient patients who were divided into bleeders or non-bleeders, based on bleeding associated with at least two tooth extractions without prophylaxis. Clot formation was triggered by recalcification and addition of tissue factor and phospholipids in the absence or presence of tissue plasminogen activator and/or thrombomodulin. Clot formation and fibrinolysis were measured by turbidity and fibrin network structure by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Non-bleeders and bleeders had similarly low FXI levels, normal prothrombin times, normal levels of fibrinogen, factor VIII, von Willebrand factor and factor XIII, and normal platelet number and function. Compared with non-bleeders, bleeders exhibited lower fibrin network density and lower clot stability in the presence of tissue plasminogen activator. In the presence of thrombomodulin, seven of eight bleeders failed to form a clot, whereas only three of eight non-bleeders did not clot.",2014,"['Zucker, M', 'Seligsohn, U', 'Salomon, O', 'Wolberg, A S']"
Altered plasma fibrin clot properties and fibrinolysis in patients with multiple myeloma.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is associated with increased risk of venous and arterial thromboembolism. Formation of denser and poorly lysable fibrin clots is observed in patients with arterial and venous thromboembolism. We investigated fibrin clot properties and their determinants in MM patients. Ex vivo plasma fibrin clot permeability, turbidity and susceptibility to lysis were evaluated in 106 MM patients at the time of diagnosis vs. 100 age- and sex-matched controls. MM patients had lower clot permeability (Ks ), compaction, indicating denser fibrin clots, impaired fibrin polymerization with longer lag phase and lower final turbidity (D-Dmax ), combined with hypofibrinolysis reflected by longer lysis time and slower rate of D-dimer release from fibrin clots (D-Drate ) compared with controls (all P < 0·001). Patients with IgG MM had lower Ks compared with IgA MM [5·9 (5·1-6·4) vs. 6·3 (5·9-7·2) 10(-9)  cm(2) ; P = 0·007] and longer lysis time compared with light-chain-disease patients [11·4 (10·9-12·3) vs. 10·7 (9·8-11·9) min; P = 0·022]. Of the fibrin variables, only Ks was significantly lower in patients with International Staging System (ISS) grade III than in those with ISS grade I and II [5·9 (4·9-6·6) vs. 6·2 (5·7-6·8) 10(-9)  cm(2) ; P = 0·015]. Multivariate analysis adjusted for age and fibrinogen showed that in MM patients elevated peak thrombin levels determine Ks and D-Dmax , while thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) activity predicts Ks , t50% , D-Drate and lag phase.",2014,"['Undas, Anetta', 'Zubkiewicz-Usnarska, Lidia', 'Helbig, Grzegorz', 'Woszczyk, Dariusz', 'Kozińska, Justyna', 'Dmoszyńska, Anna', 'Podolak-Dawidziak, Maria', 'Kuliczkowski, Kazimierz']"
Venous clot lysis and stenting.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) continues to represent a major source or mortality and morbidity. Although anticoagulation is the mainstay of therapy, adjunctive catheter-based interventions have shown substantial potential to improve clinically meaningful patient outcomes in patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) has been shown in a randomized trial to reduce the risk of PTS in patients with acute proximal DVT; data from a larger NIH trial is expected shortly. The use of CDT is being increasingly used for patients with submassive or massive pulmonary embolism. Preliminary studies suggest that endovascular stent placement and ablative therapies can improve quality-of-life in carefully selected patients with established PTS. In this article, we summarize the current status of thrombus removal and stent placement procedures for VTE and PTS, with the main purpose being to guide clinicians in individualizing treatment decisions for their challenging patients.",2015,"['Vedantham', 'Suresh']"
CVD risk factors are related to plasma fibrin clot properties independent of total and or γ' fibrinogen concentration.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors are associated with total fibrinogen concentration and/or altered clot structure. It is however, unclear whether such associations with clot structure are ascribed to fibrinogen concentration or other independent mechanisms. We aimed to determine whether CVD risk factors associated with increased total and/or γ' fibrinogen concentration, were also associated with altered fibrin clot properties and secondly whether such associations were due to the fibrinogen concentration or through independent associations. In a plasma setting CVD risk factors (including total and γ' fibrinogen concentration) were cross-sectionally analysed in 2010 apparently healthy black South African participants. Kinetics of clot formation (lag time, slope and maximum absorbance) as well as clot lysis times were calculated from turbidity curves. Of the measured CVD risk factors age, metabolic syndrome, C-reactive protein (CRP), high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and homocysteine were significantly associated with altered fibrin clot properties after adjustment for total and or γ' fibrinogen concentration. Aging was associated with thicker fibres (p=0.004) while both metabolic syndrome and low HDL-cholesterol levels were associated with lower rates of lateral aggregation (slope), (p=0.0004 and p=0.0009), and the formation of thinner fibres (p=0.007 and p=0.0004). Elevated CRP was associated with increased rates of lateral aggregation (p=0.002) and consequently thicker fibres (p<0.0001). Hyperhomocysteinemia was associated with increased rates of lateral aggregation (p=0.0007) without affecting fibre thickness.",2014,"['Kotzé, Retha C M', 'Ariëns, Robert A S', 'de Lange, Zelda', 'Pieters, Marlien']"
"Hyperglycemia is associated with enhanced thrombin formation, platelet activation, and fibrin clot resistance to lysis in patients with acute coronary syndrome.","Acute hyperglycemia on admission for acute coronary syndrome worsens the prognosis in patients with and without known diabetes. Postulated mechanisms of this observation include prothrombotic effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of elevated glucose levels on blood clotting in acute coronary syndrome patients. We studied 60 acute coronary syndrome patients within the first 12 h after pain onset, including 20 subjects with type 2 diabetes, 20 subjects with no diagnosed diabetes but with glucose levels >7.0 mmol/l, and 20 subjects with glucose levels <7.0 mmol/l. We determined generation of thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TATs) and soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L), a platelet activation marker, at the site of microvascular injury, together with ex vivo plasma fibrin clot permeability and lysis time. The acute coronary syndrome patients with no prior diabetes but elevated glucose levels had increased maximum rates of formation and total production of TATs (by 42.9%, P < 0.0001, and by 25%, P < 0.0001, respectively) as well as sCD40L release (by 16.2%, P = 0.0011, and by 16.3%, P < 0.0001, respectively) compared with those with normoglycemia, whereas diabetic patients had the highest values of TATs and sCD40L variables (P < 0.0001 for all comparisons). Patients with hyperglycemia, with no previously diagnosed diabetes, had longer clot lysis time (by approximately 18%, P < 0.0001) similar to that in diabetic subjects, but not lower clot permeability compared with that in normoglycemic subjects.",2008,"['Undas, Anetta', 'Wiek, Ilona', 'Stêpien, Ewa', 'Zmudka, Krzysztof', 'Tracz, Wieslawa']"
Prothrombotic alterations in plasma fibrin clot properties in thyroid disorders and their post-treatment modifications.,"Available data on fibrin clot properties and fibrinolysis in hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are inconsistent. Our objective was to assess the impact of effective treatment of hyper- and hypothyroidism on fibrin clot characteristics. In a case-control study, ex vivo plasma fibrin clot permeability (Ks) and efficiency of fibrinolysis were assessed in 35 consecutive hyperthyroid and 35 hypothyroid subjects versus 30 controls. All measurements were performed before and after 3months of thyroid function normalizing therapy. At baseline, hyperthyroid, but not hypothyroid, patients had lower Ks than controls (p<0.0001). Hyperthyroid and hypothyroid groups compared with controls had prolonged clot lysis time (CLT), and lower rate of D-dimer release from clots (D-Drate) (all p<0.05). The regression analysis adjusted for fibrinogen showed that in hyperthyroid patients, pre-treatment thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) independently predicted Ks, while thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) antigen predicted CLT. In hypothyroid individuals a similar regression model showed that TSH independently predicts CLT. After 3months of thyroid function normalizing therapy, 32 (91.4%) hyperthyroid and 30 (85.7%) hypothyroid subjects achieved euthyroidism and had improved fibrin clot properties (all p<0.05), with normalization of Ks in hyperthyroid and lysability in hypothyroid patients.",2014,"['Mazur, Piotr', 'Sokołowski, Grzegorz', 'Hubalewska-Dydejczyk, Alicja', 'Płaczkiewicz-Jankowska, Ewa', 'Undas, Anetta']"
The role of activated coagulation factor XII in overall clot stability and fibrinolysis.,"Activated coagulation factor XII (α-FXIIa) is able to bind to fibrin(ogen) and increases the density and stiffness of the fibrin clot. Conversely, proteins of the contact system and the fibrinolytic system show a high degree of homology and α-FXIIa can convert plasminogen into plasmin resulting in fibrin degradation. Therefore, we studied the contribution of α-FXIIa to overall clot stability and plasmin driven fibrinolysis in the absence and presence of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). We observed that α-FXIIa directly converted plasminogen into plasmin and reduced clot lysis time at all tPA concentrations tested (15-1500 pM). Simultaneous assessment of plasmin generation (chromogenic substrate S-2251) and fibrin formation and degradation (absorbance at 405nm), showed an earlier onset of fibrinolysis and plasmin formation in the presence of α-FXIIa. Fibrinolysis of clots formed under flow conditions, revealed that incorporation of α-FXIIa accelerated clot breakdown (fluorescence release of labeled fibrin) by additional plasmin generation on top of formation by tPA. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the surface area pore size increased in the presence compared with the absence of α-FXIIa when fibrinolysis was initiated by the conversion of plasminogen with tPA during clot formation. α-FXIIa enhances fibrinolysis in the presence of plasminogen, irrespective of whether tPA was present during clot formation or was added afterwards to initiate fibrinolysis. We postulate that FXIIa first strengthens the clot structure during clot formation and thereafter contributes towards fibrinolysis.",2015,"['Konings, Joke', 'Hoving, Lisa R', 'Ariëns, Robert S', 'Hethershaw, Emma L', 'Ninivaggi, Marisa', 'Hardy, Lewis J', 'de Laat, Bas', 'Ten Cate, Hugo', 'Philippou, Helen', 'Govers-Riemslag, José W P']"
"Denser plasma clot formation and impaired fibrinolysis in paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation while on sinus rhythm: association with thrombin generation, endothelial injury and platelet activation.","Formation of compact and poorly lysable fibrin clots have been demonstrated in patients following ischemic stroke. Recently, it has been shown that denser fibrin networks and impaired fibrinolysis occurs in subjects with permanent atrial fibrillation (AF). Fibrin clot phenotype in other types of AF remains to be established. We evaluated fibrin clot properties in paroxysmal (PAF) and persistent AF (PsAF). We studied 88 non-anticoagulated patients with AF on sinus rhythm and free of stroke (41 with PAF, 47 with PsAF) versus 50 controls. Ex-vivo plasma fibrin clot permeability (Ks) and clot lysis time (CLT) were evaluated along with von Willebrand factor (vWF), peak thrombin generation (TG), platelet factor 4 (PF4) and fibrinolytic proteins. Compared with control subjects, clots obtained from plasma of patients with PAF and PsAF had similarly lower Ks (-7.7%, P=0.01; -8.6%, P=0.005, respectively) and prolonged CLT (+10.8%, P=0.006; +7.8% P=0.04, respectively). No associations of Ks and CLT with CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED score were observed. Patients with AF had higher TG, vWF, PF4 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen compared with controls. Multiple linear regression adjusted for age, gender, body mass index and fibrinogen showed that TG (β=-0.41), vWF (β=-0.29) and PF4 (β=-0.28) are the independent predictors of Ks (R(2)=0.78), while CLT was independently predicted by TG (β=0.37), PAI-1 antigen (β=0.29) and vWF (β=0.26) in the AF group (R(2)=0.39).",2015,"['Drabik, Leszek', 'Wołkow, Paweł', 'Undas, Anetta']"
Increased zymogen activity of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor prolongs clot lysis.,"Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is a zymogen that can be activated by proteolytic cleavage into the active enzyme TAFIa. Hydrolysis of the C-terminal lysines on fibrin by TAFIa results in a down-regulation of fibrinolysis. Recent studies demonstrated that the zymogen also exerts an intrinsic enzymatic activity. Our objective was to identify and characterize zymogen-stimulatory nanobodies. The screening of 24 nanobodies against TAFI revealed that two nanobodies (i.e. Vhh-TAFI-a51 and Vhh-TAFI-i103) were able to stimulate the zymogen activity 10- to 21-fold compared with the baseline zymogen activity of TAFI. The increase in catalytic efficiency can be attributed mainly to an increased catalytic rate, as no change in the K(M) -value was observed. The stability, the susceptibility towards PTCI and GEMSA and the kinetics of the stimulated zymogen activity differ significantly from those of TAFIa activity. Epitope mapping revealed that both Asp(75) and Thr(301) are major determinants in the binding of these nanobodies to TAFI. Localization of the epitope strongly suggests that this instability is as a result of a disruption of the stabilizing interactions between the activation peptide and the dynamic flap region (residues 296-350). In TAFI-depleted plasma reconstituted with a non-activatable variant of TAFI (TAFI-R92A), clot lysis could be prolonged by nanobody-induced stimulation of its zymogen activity as well as by increasing its concentration.",2012,"['Mishra, N', 'Buelens, K', 'Theyskens, S', 'Compernolle, G', 'Gils, A', 'Declerck, P J']"
Resolution of intraventricular hemorrhage varies by ventricular region and dose of intraventricular thrombolytic: the Clot Lysis: Evaluating Accelerated Resolution of IVH (CLEAR IVH) program.,"The Clot Lysis: Evaluating Accelerated Resolution of IVH (CLEAR IVH) program is assessing the efficacy of intraventricular recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rtPA) for spontaneous intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). This subanalysis assesses the effect of dose of rtPA by region on clearance of IVH. Sixty-four patients within 12 to 24 hours of spontaneous IVH were randomized to placebo or 0.3 mg, 1 mg, or 3 mg of rtPA twice daily through an extraventricular drain. Twelve subregions of the ventricles were scored from 0 to 4. Effect of dose on IVH clearance to 50% of baseline score was compared by survival analysis for all regions combined and by subregion. Models including ventricular region, dose, and baseline score were compared by Cox proportional hazards. IVH score reduced faster across all regions with increasing rtPA dose (clearance to 50%: log-rank P<0.0001; placebo-11.43 days, 95% CI, 5.68-17.18; 0.3 mg-3.19 days, 1.00-5.38; 1 mg-3.54 days, 0.45-6.64; 3 mg-2.59 days, 1.72-3.46). In the combined models, dose and baseline score were independently associated with reduction in IVH score, which was quickest in the midline ventricles, then the anterior half of the lateral ventricles and slowest in the posterior half of the lateral ventricles (clearance to 50%: P<0.0001; rtPA dose: hazard ratio, 1.47, 1.30-1.67; midline versus anterolateral hazard ratio, 1.71, 1.08-2.71; midline versus posterolateral hazard ratio, 4.05, 2.46-6.65; baseline score hazard ratio, 0.96, 0.91-1.01) with a significant interaction between dose and ventricular region (P=0.005).",2012,"['Webb, Alastair J S', 'Ullman, Natalie L', 'Mann, Sarah', 'Muschelli, John', 'Awad, Issam A', 'Hanley, Daniel F']"
Contact activation prolongs clot lysis time in human plasma: role of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor and Factor XIII.,"Contact activation system proteins (e.g., Factor XII, kallikrein) have been implicated as direct or indirect activators of plasminogen. However, contact activation and Factor XI have enhanced thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) activation and decreased fibrinolysis, and Factor XIII (FXIII) also delays fibrinolysis via alpha(2)-anti-plasmin deposition on fibrin polymers. Thus, the goals of this study were to define how fibrinolysis is modulated in human plasma by contact or tissue factor (TF) activation, and what role TAFI and FXIII plays in this system. Normal, TAFI-deficient and TAFI-deficient/FXIII-supplemented plasma was exposed to tissue-type plasminogen activator and activated with either celite or TF. Clot growth/disintegration kinetics were documented with thrombelastography. Normal plasma activated with celite had significantly prolonged onset and duration of clot lysis compared with samples activated with TF. TAFI-deficient plasma activated with celite was noted to have a duration of clot lysis not different from samples activated with TF, but a significant difference in time to onset of lysis persisted. Celite activation of TAFI-deficient/FXIII-supplemented plasma showed significantly prolonged onset and duration of clot lysis compared with samples activated with TF.",2006,"['Nielsen, Vance G', 'Steenwyk, Brad L', 'Gurley, William Q']"
Utility of clot formation and lysis assay to monitor global coagulation state of patients with severe acute pancreatitis.,"Systemic inflammation affects hemostasis during severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). A hypercoagulable state occurs more frequently in SAP, which is not fully detected by traditional coagulation testing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of clot formation and lysis (CloFAL) assay to improve monitoring of global coagulation in patients with SAP. Twenty-five patients with SAP who were treated from December 2009 to April 2011 were studied. Plasma was collected at the time of admission, and CloFAL was measured using the CloFAL analyzer. The parameters evaluated include coagulation time (CT), fibrinolysis time (FT), and maximum amplitude (MA), from which the accelerating coagulation extent (ACE, MA/CT), accelerating fibrinolytic extent (AFE, MA/FT), and balance level exponent (BLE, ACE/AFE) were calculated. In addition, laboratory values for the traditional coagulation testing were measured. Values were compared to a control group of 20 healthy subjects. The MA, FT, ACE, and BLE values of the CloFAL assay were significantly increased in the SAP group compared to the control group (p\0.05 for all measurements). For the traditional coagulation testing, fibrinogen, plasminogen, and D-dimer levels were higher in patients in the SAP group compared to the control group (p\0.05).",2012,"['Zhu, Rongtao', 'Wei, Sidong', 'Wu, Chuanxin', 'Li, Shengwei', 'Gong, Jianping']"
"Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in humans: hematoma enlargement, clot lysis, and brain edema.","Early hematoma enlargement and delayed clot lysis contribute to brain injury after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We investigated hematoma growth, clot lysis, and brain edema formation in patients with spontaneous ICH. A total of 17 spontaneous ICH patients who received regular medication were chosen for this study. All patients had their first CT scan within 5 hours of onset of symptoms (day 0). The patients then underwent second, third, and fourth CT scans at 1, 3, and 10 days later. Hematoma size and absolute and relative brain edema volumes were measured. Hematoma enlargement was defined as a > 33% increase in volume. Relative brain edema volume = absolute brain edema volume/hematoma size. Hematoma enlargement occurred in 4 of the 17 ICH patients (24%) within the first 24 hours. The hematoma sizes were reduced significantly at day 10 (p < 0.05) because of clot lysis. However, both absolute and relative brain edema increased gradually with time (p < 0.01). These results suggest that delayed brain edema following ICH may result from hematoma lysis. This study also shows that early hematoma enlargement occurs in Chinese patients with ICH. Reducing early hematoma growth and limiting clot lysis-induced brain toxicity could be potential therapies for ICH.",2006,"['Wu, G', 'Xi, G', 'Huang, F']"
Lp(a) is not associated with diabetes but affects fibrinolysis and clot structure ex vivo.,"Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] is a low density lipoprotein (LDL) with one apolipoprotein (a) molecule bound to the apolipoprotein B-100 of LDL. Lp(a) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the relationship of Lp(a) to diabetes and metabolic syndrome, both known for increased CVD risk, is controversial. In a population based study on type two diabetes mellitus (T2DM) development in women, Lp(a) plasma levels showed the well known skewed distribution without any relation to diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. A modified clot lysis assay on a subset of 274 subjects showed significantly increased clot lysis times in T2DM subjects, despite inhibition of PAI-1 and TAFI. Lp(a) plasma levels significantly increased the maximal peak height of the clot lysis curve, indicating a change in clot structure. In this study Lp(a) is not related to the development of T2DM but may affect clot structure ex vivo without a prolongation of the clot lysis time.",2014,"['Månsson, Marianne', 'Kalies, Inge', 'Bergström, Göran', 'Schmidt, Caroline', 'Legnehed, Anne', 'Hultén, Lillemor Mattsson', 'Amrot-Fors, Lena', 'Gustafsson, David', 'Knecht, Wolfgang']"
Herpesviruses enhance fibrin clot lysis.,"The incorporation of virus- and host-derived procoagulant factors initiates clotting directly on the surface of herpesviruses, which is an explanation for their correlation to vascular disease. The virus exploits the resulting thrombin to enhance infection by modulating the host cell through protease activated receptor (PAR) 1 signalling. Prior reports demonstrated that at least one herpesvirus expresses surface annexin A2 (A2), a cofactor for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-dependent activation of plasminogen to plasmin. Since plasmin is both a fibrinolytic protease and PAR agonist, we investigated whether herpesviruses enhance fibrinolysis and the effect of plasmin on cell infection. Herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV1) and 2, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) purified from various cell lines each accelerated the proteolytic activation of plasminogen to plasmin by tPA. Ligand blots identified A2 as one of several plasminogen binding partners associated with the virus when compared to an A2-deficient virus. This was confirmed with inhibitory A2-antibodies. However, A2 was not required for virus-enhanced plasmin generation. HSV1, HSV2 and CMV accelerated tPA-dependent fibrin clot lysis by up to 2.8-fold. Modest plasmin generation and fibrinolysis was detected independent of exogenous tPA, which was inhibited by plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 and ε-aminocaproic acid; however, the molecular basis remains speculative. Up to a ~6-fold enhancement of infection was provided by plasmin-mediated cell infection. Inhibitory antibodies revealed that plasmin increased HSV1 infection through a mechanism involving PAR2. Thus, virus-enhanced fibrinolysis may help explain the paradox of the highly procoagulant in vitro herpesvirus surface eliciting only relatively weak independent vascular disease risk.",2012,"['Gershom, E S', 'Vanden Hoek, A L', 'Meixner, S C', 'Sutherland, M R', 'Pryzdial, E L G']"
Unfavorably Altered Fibrin Clot Properties in Patients with Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss Syndrome): Association with Thrombin Generation and Eosinophilia.,"Given reports on the increased prevalence of thromboembolic incidents in patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA; Churg-Strauss syndrome), we investigated whether fibrin clot properties are unfavorably altered in EGPA. Ex vivo plasma fibrin clot characteristics, including clot permeability, turbidimetry and efficiency of fibrinolysis using two assays, were investigated in 34 consecutive patients with remission in EGPA according to the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score version 3 (23 female, 11 male), aged 48 (range, 21-80) years. The control group comprised 34 age- and sex- matched volunteers. Compared with controls, patients with EGPA were characterized by denser fiber clots (estimated pore size, Ks, 7.30±0.93 vs 10.14±1.07 10-9 cm2), faster fibrin polymerization (lag phase in a turbidimetric curve, 41.8±3.6 vs 47.4±2.9 s), thicker fibrin fibers (maximum absorbance, ΔAbs, 0.87±0.09 vs 0.72±0.07), higher maximum levels of D-dimer released from clots (DDmax 4.10±0.46 vs 3.54±0.35 mg/L), and prolonged clot lysis time (t50%; 9.50±1.45 vs 7.56±0.87 min); all p<0.0001. Scanning electron microscopy images confirmed denser plasma fibrin networks composed of thinner fibers formed in EGPA. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody status and C-reactive protein did not affect clot variables. Multivariate analysis adjusted for fibrinogen showed that Ks was predicted by eosinophil count, peak thrombin generation, factor VIII, and soluble CD40 ligand, whereas eosinophil count, peak thrombin generation and antiplasmin predicted t50%.",2015,"['Mastalerz, Lucyna', 'Celińska-Lӧwenhoff, Magdalena', 'Krawiec, Piotr', 'Batko, Bogdan', 'Tłustochowicz, Witold', 'Undas, Anetta']"
"Effects of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants on fibrin clot and whole blood clot formation, integrity and thrombolysis in patients with atrial fibrillation.","Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are replacing warfarin and heparins in several clinical situations. With varying modes of action, the effects of NOACs on thrombus formation, integrity, and lysis is unknown. To determine whether two techniques of thrombelastography (TEG) and a micro-plate assay (MPA) provide novel data on thrombus formation, integrity and lysis in those taking a NOACs compared to warfarin and a control group taking aspirin. We assessed thrombogenesis, clot integrity and fibrinolysis in blood (TEG) and plasma (MPA) from 182 atrial fibrillation patients-50 on aspirin, 50 on warfarin, and 82 on a NOAC (17 apixaban, 19 dabigatran and 46 rivaroxaban). Eleven of 16 TEG indices and 4 of 5 MPA indices differed (p ≤ 0.01) between those on aspirin, warfarin or a NOAC. Three TEG indices and 4 MPA indices differed (p < 0.01) between the NOACs. Time to initiation of clot formation was most rapid on apixaban, then rivaroxaban and slowest on dabigatran. The rate of clot formation was most rapid on dabigatran, then apixaban, and slowest on rivaroxaban. Clot density was greatest on rivaroxaban, then apixaban, but weakest on dabigatran. The rate of clot dissolution was most rapid in apixaban, then dabigatran, and slowest on rivaroxaban. The TEG and MPA identify major differences in thrombogenesis and fibrinolysis in different NOACs. These techniques may have value in investigating the effects of these drugs on haemostasis in a clinical setting, and in identifying those in need of targeted therapy.",2016,"['Lau, Yee Cheng', 'Xiong, Qinmei', 'Shantsila, Eduard', 'Lip, Gregory Y H', 'Blann, Andrew D']"
Effect of oxidation-modified fibrinogen on the formation and lysis of fibrin clot in the plasma.,"Turbidimetry studies showed that after addition of thrombin to fresh donor plasma light scatter in the sample increases and slowly attains a plateau. The process of fibrin formation was less intensive in the presence of oxidized fibrinogen. The formation of fibrin clot in lyophilized plasma was characterized by a biphasic kinetic of light scatter, oxidized fibrinogen inhibited both phases of the process. In the presence of streptokinase, oxidized fibrinogen did not modify the kinetics of fibrin clot lysis. Addition of oxidized fibrinogen to plasma reduced optical density of fibrin clot the more intensely the higher was the degree of oxidative modification of fibrinogen.",2009,"['Piryazev, A P', 'Aseichev, A V', 'Azizova, O A']"
Clot properties and cardiovascular disease.,"Fibrinogen is cleaved by thrombin to fibrin, which provides the blood clot with its essential structural backbone. As an acute phase protein, the plasma levels of fibrinogen are increased in response to inflammatory conditions. In addition to fibrinogen levels, fibrin clot structure is altered by a number of factors. These include thrombin levels, treatment with common cardiovascular medications, such as aspirin, anticoagulants, statins and fibrates, as well as metabolic disease states such as diabetes mellitus and hyperhomocysteinaemia. In vitro studies of fibrin clot structure can provide information regarding fibre density, clot porosity, the mechanical strength of fibres and fibrinolysis. A change in fibrin clot structure, to a denser clot with smaller pores which is more resistant to lysis, is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease. This pathological change is present in patients with arterial as well as venous diseases, and is also found in a moderate form in relatives of patients with cardiovascular disease. Pharmacological therapies, aimed at both the treatment and prophylaxis of cardiovascular disease, appear to result in positive changes to the fibrin clot structure. As such, therapies aimed at 'normalising' fibrin clot structure may be of benefit in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease.",2014,"['Bridge, Katherine I', 'Philippou, Helen', 'Ariëns, Robert A S']"
