The role of activated coagulation factor XII in overall clot stability and fibrinolysis.,"Activated coagulation factor XII (α-FXIIa) is able to bind to fibrin(ogen) and increases the density and stiffness of the fibrin clot. Conversely, proteins of the contact system and the fibrinolytic system show a high degree of homology and α-FXIIa can convert plasminogen into plasmin resulting in fibrin degradation. Therefore, we studied the contribution of α-FXIIa to overall clot stability and plasmin driven fibrinolysis in the absence and presence of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). We observed that α-FXIIa directly converted plasminogen into plasmin and reduced clot lysis time at all tPA concentrations tested (15-1500 pM). Simultaneous assessment of plasmin generation (chromogenic substrate S-2251) and fibrin formation and degradation (absorbance at 405nm), showed an earlier onset of fibrinolysis and plasmin formation in the presence of α-FXIIa. Fibrinolysis of clots formed under flow conditions, revealed that incorporation of α-FXIIa accelerated clot breakdown (fluorescence release of labeled fibrin) by additional plasmin generation on top of formation by tPA. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the surface area pore size increased in the presence compared with the absence of α-FXIIa when fibrinolysis was initiated by the conversion of plasminogen with tPA during clot formation. α-FXIIa enhances fibrinolysis in the presence of plasminogen, irrespective of whether tPA was present during clot formation or was added afterwards to initiate fibrinolysis. We postulate that FXIIa first strengthens the clot structure during clot formation and thereafter contributes towards fibrinolysis.",2015,"['Konings, Joke', 'Hoving, Lisa R', 'Ariëns, Robert S', 'Hethershaw, Emma L', 'Ninivaggi, Marisa', 'Hardy, Lewis J', 'de Laat, Bas', 'Ten Cate, Hugo', 'Philippou, Helen', 'Govers-Riemslag, José W P']"
"Acute Fibrinolysis Shutdown after Injury Occurs Frequently and Increases Mortality: A Multicenter Evaluation of 2,540 Severely Injured Patients.","Fibrinolysis is a physiologic process that maintains microvascular patency by breaking down excessive fibrin clot. Hyperfibrinolysis is associated with a doubling of mortality. Fibrinolysis shutdown, an acute impairment of fibrinolysis, has been recognized as a risk factor for increased mortality. The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence and outcomes of fibrinolysis phenotypes in 2 urban trauma centers. Injured patients included in the analysis were admitted between 2010 and 2013, were 18 years of age or older, and had an Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 15. Admission fibrinolysis phenotypes were determined by the clot lysis at 30 minutes (LY30): shutdown ≤ 0.8%, physiologic 0.9% to 2.9%, and hyperfibrinolysis ≥ 3%. Logistic regression was used to adjust for age, arrival blood pressure, ISS, mechanism, and facility. There were 2,540 patients who met inclusion criteria. Median age was 39 years (interquartile range [IQR] 26 to 55 years) and median ISS was 25 (IQR 20 to 33), with a mortality rate of 21%. Fibrinolysis shutdown was the most common phenotype (46%) followed by physiologic (36%) and hyperfibrinolysis (18%). Hyperfibrinolysis was associated with the highest death rate (34%), followed by shutdown (22%), and physiologic (14%, p < 0.001). The risk of mortality remained increased for hyperfibrinolysis (odds ratio [OR] 3.3, 95% CI 2.4 to 4.6, p < 0.0001) and shutdown (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.1, p = 0.0003) compared with physiologic when adjusting for age, ISS, mechanism, head injury, and blood pressure (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve 0.82, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.84).",2016,"['Moore, Hunter B', 'Moore, Ernest E', 'Liras, Ioannis N', 'Gonzalez, Eduardo', 'Harvin, John A', 'Holcomb, John B', 'Sauaia, Angela', 'Cotton, Bryan A']"
Shock releases bile acid inducing platelet inhibition and fibrinolysis.,"Metabolites are underappreciated for their effect on coagulation. Taurocholic acid (TUCA), a bile acid, has been shown to regulate cellular activity and promote fibrin sealant degradation. We hypothesize that TUCA impairs whole blood clot formation and promotes fibrinolysis. TUCA was exogenously added to whole blood obtained from volunteers. A titration from 250 μM-750 μM was used due to biologic relevance. Whole blood mixtures were assayed using thrombelastography for clot strength (maximum amplitude [MA]) and fibrinolysis (LY30) quantification. Tranexamic acid was used to block plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis. Platelet microfluidics were performed. A proteomic analysis was completed on citrated plasma obtained from a shock and resuscitation rat model. Fibrinolysis increased when 750-μM TUCA was added to whole blood (median LY30 0.08-5.7, P = 0.010) and clot strength decreased (median MA of 53.3-43.8, P = 0.010). The addition of tranexamic acid, to a 750-μM TUCA titration, partially reversed the induced fibrinolysis (LY30: without 7.7 versus with 2.7) and the decrease in clot strength (MA: without 48.2 versus with 53.2), but did not reverse the effects to whole blood levels. Platelet function reduced by 50% in the presence of 100-μM TUCA. Rats had a median 52-fold increase in TUCA, after a shock state that stayed elevated after resuscitation.",2015,"['Wiener, Gregory', 'Moore, Hunter B', 'Moore, Ernest E', 'Gonzalez, Eduardo', 'Diamond, Scott', 'Zhu, Shu', ""D'Alessandro, Angelo"", 'Banerjee, Anirban']"
Cell-Free DNA Modulates Clot Structure and Impairs Fibrinolysis in Sepsis.,"Sepsis is characterized by systemic activation of inflammation and coagulation in response to infection. In sepsis, activated neutrophils extrude neutrophil extracellular traps composed of cell-free DNA (CFDNA) that not only trap pathogens but also provide a stimulus for clot formation. Although the effect of CFDNA on coagulation has been extensively studied, much less is known about the impact of CFDNA on fibrinolysis. To address this, we (1) investigated the relationship between CFDNA levels and fibrinolytic activity in sepsis and (2) determined the mechanisms by which CFDNA modulates fibrinolysis. Plasma was collected from healthy and septic individuals, and CFDNA was quantified. Clot lysis assays were performed in plasma and purified systems, and lysis times were determined by monitoring absorbance. Clot morphology was assessed using scanning electron microscopy. Clots formed in plasma from septic patients containing >5 µg/mL CFDNA were dense in structure and resistant to fibrinolysis, a phenomenon overcome by deoxyribonuclease addition. These effects were recapitulated in control plasma supplemented with CFDNA. In a purified system, CFDNA delayed fibrinolysis but did not alter tissue-type plasminogen activator-induced plasmin generation. Using surface plasmon resonance, CFDNA bound plasmin with a Kd value of 4.2±0.3 µmol/L, and increasing concentrations of CFDNA impaired plasmin-mediated degradation of fibrin clots via the formation of a nonproductive ternary complex between plasmin, CFDNA, and fibrin.",2015,"['Gould, Travis J', 'Vu, Trang T', 'Stafford, Alan R', 'Dwivedi, Dhruva J', 'Kim, Paul Y', 'Fox-Robichaud, Alison E', 'Weitz, Jeffrey I', 'Liaw, Patricia C']"
Peroxynitrite may affect fibrinolysis via the reduction of platelet-related fibrinolysis resistance and alteration of clot structure.,"We tested the hypothesis that in vitro peroxynitrite (ONOO(-), a product of activated inflammatory cells) may affect fibrinolysis in human blood through the reduction of platelet-related fibrinolysis resistance. It was found that ONOO(-) (25-300 µM) accelerated lysis of platelet-fibrin clots (in PRP) dose-dependently, whereas fibrinolysis of platelet-free clots was slightly inhibited by ≥ 1000 µM stressor. Concentrations of ONOO(-) affecting the lysis of platelet-rich clots, inhibited clot retraction (CR) in a dose-dependent manner. Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) measurements performed in PRP showed that treatment with ONOO(-) (threshold conc. 100 µM) prolongs clotting time, and reduces alpha angle, and clot formation velocity parameters indicating for reduced thrombin formation rate. In PRP, ONOO(-) (threshold conc. 100 µM) reduced the collagen-evoked exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on platelets' plasma membrane, the shedding of platelet-derived microparticles (PMP), and inhibited platelet-dependent thrombin generation (measured in artificial system), dose-dependently. As judged by confocal microscopy, similar ONOO(-) concentrations altered the architecture of clots formed in collagen-treated PRP. Clots formed in the presence of ONOO(-) were less dense and were composed of thicker fibers, which make them more susceptible to lysis. In platelet-depleted plasma, ONOO(-) (up to milimolar concentration) did not alter clot structure. Blockage of PS exposed on platelets resulted in an alteration of clot architecture toward more prone to lysis. ONOO(-), at lysis-affecting concentrations, inhibited the collagen-evoked secretion of fibrinolytic inhibitors from platelets. We conclude that physiologically relevant ONOO(-) concentrations may accelerate the lysis of platelet-fibrin clots predominantly via downregulation of platelet-related mechanisms including: platelet secretion, clot retraction, platelet procoagulant response, and the alteration in clot architecture associated with it.",2015,"['Misztal, Tomasz', 'Rusak, Tomasz', 'Brańska-Januszewska, Justyna', 'Ostrowska, Halina', 'Tomasiak, Marian']"
Fibrinolysis shutdown phenotype masks changes in rodent coagulation in tissue injury versus hemorrhagic shock.,"Systemic hyperfibrinolysis (accelerated clot degradation) and fibrinolysis shutdown (impaired clot degradation) are associated with increased mortality compared with physiologic fibrinolysis after trauma. Animal models have not reproduced these changes. We hypothesize rodents have a shutdown phenotype that require an exogenous profibrinolytic to differentiate mechanisms that promote or inhibit fibrinolysis. Fibrinolysis resistance was assessed by thrombelastography (TEG) using exogenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) titrations in whole blood. There were 3 experimental groups: (1) tissue injury (laparotomy/bowel crush), (2) shock (hemorrhage to mean arterial pressure of 20 mmHg), and (3) control (arterial cannulation and tracheostomy). Baseline and 30-minute postintervention blood samples were collected, and assayed with TEG challenged with taurocholic acid (TUCA). Rats were resistant to exogenous tPA; the percent clot remaining 30 minutes after maximum amplitude (CL30) at 150 ng/mL (P = .511) and 300 ng/mL (P = .931) was similar to baseline, whereas 600 ng/mL (P = .046) provoked fibrinolysis. Using the TUCA challenge, the percent change in CL30 from baseline was increased in tissue injury compared with control (P = .048.), whereas CL30 decreased in shock versus control (P = .048). tPA increased in the shock group compared with tissue injury (P = .009) and control (P = .012).",2015,"['Moore, Hunter B', 'Moore, Ernest E', 'Lawson, Peter J', 'Gonzalez, Eduardo', 'Fragoso, Miguel', 'Morton, Alex P', 'Gamboni, Fabia', 'Chapman, Michael P', 'Sauaia, Angela', 'Banerjee, Anirban', 'Silliman, Christopher C']"
Assessment of Fibrinolysis in Sepsis Patients with Urokinase Modified Thromboelastography.,"Impairment of fibrinolysis during sepsis is associated with worse outcome. Early identification of this condition could be of interest. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a modified point-of-care viscoelastic hemostatic assay can detect sepsis-induced impairment of fibrinolysis and to correlate impaired fibrinolysis with morbidity and mortality. This single center observational prospective pilot study was performed in an adult Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a tertiary academic hospital. Forty consecutive patients admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis or septic shock were included. Forty healthy individuals served as controls. We modified conventional kaolin activated thromboelastography (TEG) adding urokinase to improve assessment of fibrinolysis in real time (UK-TEG). TEG, UK-TEG, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), d-dimer, DIC scores and morbidity (rated with the SOFA score) were measured upon ICU admission. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of mortality at ICU discharge. UK-TEG revealed a greater impairment of fibrinolysis in sepsis patients compared to healthy individuals confirmed by PAI-1. TAFI was not different between sepsis patients and healthy individuals. 18/40 sepsis patients had fibrinolysis impaired according to UK-TEG and showed higher SOFA score (8 (6-13) vs 5 (4-7), p = 0.03), higher mortality (39% vs 5%, p = 0.01) and greater markers of cellular damage (lactate levels, LDH and bilirubin). Mortality at ICU discharge was predicted by the degree of fibrinolysis impairment measured by UK-TEG Ly30 (%) parameter (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.93-0.98, p = 0.003).",2015,"['Panigada, Mauro', 'Zacchetti, Lucia', ""L'Acqua, Camilla"", 'Cressoni, Massimo', 'Anzoletti, Massimo Boscolo', 'Bader, Rossella', 'Protti, Alessandro', 'Consonni, Dario', ""D'Angelo, Armando"", 'Gattinoni, Luciano']"
No increased systemic fibrinolysis in women with heavy menstrual bleeding.,"Bleeding disorders have been recognized as important etiologic or contributory factors in women with heavy menstrual bleeding. Fibrinolysis in the endometrium plays a role in heavy menstrual bleeding. It is unknown whether increased systemic fibrinolysis might also increase the risk of heavy menstrual bleeding. To investigate fibrinolytic parameters, including clot lysis time, in women with heavy menstrual bleeding. We included 102 patients referred for heavy menstrual bleeding (Pictorial Bleeding Assessment Chart score of > 100) in our cohort. Patients and controls (28 healthy volunteers without heavy menstrual bleeding) underwent hemostatic testing in the first week after menstruation. For 79 patients and all controls, fibrinolytic parameters (thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor activity, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, tissue-type plasminogen activator and plasmin inhibitor levels) and clot lysis time were available. Fibrinolytic parameters were similar between patients and controls, except for thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (89.4% vs. 82.5%) and plasmin inhibitor (106% vs. 96%), the levels of which which were significantly higher in patients. In women with menorrhagia without gynecologic abnormalities, we found lower thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels than in women with gynecologic abnormalities (thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, 85.4% vs. 94.8%; plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, 16.0 μg L(-1) vs. 24.5 μg L(-1) ).",2014,"['Wiewel-Verschueren, S', 'Knol, H M', 'Lisman, T', 'Bogchelman, D H', 'Kluin-Nelemans, J C', 'van der Zee, A G J', 'Mulder, A B', 'Meijer, K']"
Platelet-related fibrinolysis resistance in patients suffering from PV. Impact of clot retraction and isovolemic erythrocytapheresis.,"Using patients with polycythemia vera (PV) as an experimental model, we evaluated the impact of clot retraction (CR) and architecture of the clot on fibrinolysis. We studied the kinetics of clot retraction and the fibrinolysis rate in whole blood from 48 PV patients and 48 healthy controls. Measurements were performed before and after isovolemic eryhrocytapheresis (ECP). CR was measured by optical method. Clot lysis time (CLT) and maximum clot firmness (MCF) were measured by thromboelastometry in recalcified blood supplemented with t-PA and tissue factor. Compared with healthy controls, CR rate in PV patients was higher (0.0219 vs. 0.0138; p<0.001), the clot volume smaller and MCF elevated (64 vs. 58 mm). CR rate correlated with platelet count (r=0.546; p=0.001) but not with erythrocyte concentration (r=0.192; p>0.3). Compared with healthy controls, CLT in PV patients was significantly prolonged (158 min vs. 71 min). Fibrinolysis rate inversely correlated with CR rate (r=-0.566; p<0.001); MCF (r=-0.704; p<0.001) and platelet count (r=-0.461; p<0.001). As judged by confocal microscope, in comparison to healthy controls, clots formed in blood from PV patients demonstrated booth a distinctly higher degree of crosslinking and possessed thinner fibers. Altered CR, MCF and fibrinolysis speeds were not normalized following the ECP procedure. Tirofiban (a blocker of platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptors), unlike aspirin, normalized abnormal CR and fibrinolysis in blood from PV patients. Collectively, our data indicate that in PV patients, abnormal CR may result in formation of thrombi that are more resistant to fibrinolysis. ECP and aspirin failed to normalize platelet-related fibrinolysis resistance.",2014,"['Rusak, Tomasz', 'Piszcz, Jarosław', 'Misztal, Tomasz', 'Brańska-Januszewska, Justyna', 'Tomasiak, Marian']"
"Hemolysis exacerbates hyperfibrinolysis, whereas platelolysis shuts down fibrinolysis: evolving concepts of the spectrum of fibrinolysis in response to severe injury.","We have recently identified a spectrum of fibrinolysis in response to injury, in which there is increased mortality in patients who have either excessive fibrinolysis (hyperfibrinolysis [HF]) or impaired fibrinolysis (shutdown). The regulation of the fibrinolytic system after trauma remains poorly understood. Our group's previous proteomic and metabolomic work identified elevated red blood cell (RBC) degradation products in trauma patients manifesting HF. We therefore hypothesized that hemolysis was contributory to the pathogenesis of HF. Given the central role of platelets in the cell-based model of coagulation, we further investigated the potential role of platelet lysis in mediation of the fibrinolytic system. Red blood cells from healthy donors were frozen in liquid nitrogen and vortexed to create mechanical membrane disruption. Platelets were prepared in a similar fashion. Assays were performed with citrated whole blood mixed ex vivo with either RBC or platelet lysates. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was then added to promote fibrinolysis, mimicking the tPA release from ischemic endothelium during hemorrhagic shock. The degree of fibrinolysis was evaluated with thromboelastography. To identify the mediators of the fibrinolysis system present in RBC and platelet lysates, these lysates were passed over immobilized tPA and plasminogen affinity columns to capture protein-binding partners from RBC or platelet lysates. The addition of 75 ng/mL of tPA to whole blood increased fibrinolysis from median 30-min lysis of 1.4% (interquartile range [IQR], 0.9%-2.0%) to 8.9% (IQR, 6.5%-11.5%). Red blood cell lysate with tPA increased fibrinolysis to 20.1% (IQR, 12.5%-33.7%), which was nearly three times as much lysis as tPA alone (P < 0.001). Conversely, the addition of platelet lysate decreased tPA-mediated fibrinolysis to 0.35% (IQR, 0.2%-0.8%; P < 0.001). Affinity chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry identified a number of proteins not previously associated with regulation of fibrinolysis and trauma.",2015,"['Moore, Hunter B', 'Moore, Ernest E', 'Gonzalez, Eduardo', 'Hansen, Kirk C', 'Dzieciatkowska, Monika', 'Chapman, Michael P', 'Sauaia, Angela', 'West, Bernadette', 'Banerjee, Anirban', 'Silliman, Christopher C']"
"Hyperfibrinolysis, physiologic fibrinolysis, and fibrinolysis shutdown: the spectrum of postinjury fibrinolysis and relevance to antifibrinolytic therapy.","Fibrinolysis is a physiologic process maintaining patency of the microvasculature. Maladaptive overactivation of this essential function (hyperfibrinolysis) is proposed as a pathologic mechanism of trauma-induced coagulopathy. Conversely, the shutdown of fibrinolysis has also been observed as a pathologic phenomenon. We hypothesize that there is a level of fibrinolysis between these two extremes that have a survival benefit for the severely injured patients. Thrombelastography and clinical data were prospectively collected on trauma patients admitted to our Level I trauma center from 2010 to 2013. Patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 15 or greater were evaluated. The percentage of fibrinolysis at 30 minutes by thrombelastography was used to stratify three groups as follows: hyperfibrinolysis (≥3%), physiologic (0.081-2.9%), and shutdown (0-0.08%). The threshold for hyperfibrinolysis was based on existing literature. The remaining groups were established on a cutoff of 0.8%, determined by the highest point of specificity and sensitivity for mortality on a receiver operating characteristic curve. One hundred eighty patients were included in the study. The median age was 42 years (interquartile range [IQR], 28-55 years), 70% were male, and 21% had penetrating injuries. The median ISS was 29 (IQR, 22-36), and the median base deficit was 9 mEq/L (IQR, 6-13 mEq/L). Distribution of fibrinolysis was as follows: shutdown, 64% (115 of 180); physiologic, 18% (32 of 180); and hyperfibrinolysis, 18% (33 of 180). Mortality rates were lower for the physiologic group (3%) compared with the hyperfibrinolysis (44%) and shutdown (17%) groups (p = 0.001). We have identified a U-shaped distribution of death related to the fibrinolysis system in response to major trauma, with a nadir in mortality, with level of fibrinolysis after 30 minutes between 0.81% and 2.9%. Exogenous inhibition of the fibrinolysis system in severely injured patients requires careful selection, as it may have an adverse affect on survival.",2014,"['Moore, Hunter B', 'Moore, Ernest E', 'Gonzalez, Eduardo', 'Chapman, Michael P', 'Chin, Theresa L', 'Silliman, Christopher C', 'Banerjee, Anirban', 'Sauaia, Angela']"
Impact of dabigatran on platelet function and fibrinolysis.,"We sought to evaluate the potential enhanced fibrinolytic and antiplatelet activity of dabigatran etexilate (DE) due to decreased thrombin levels in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack and non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Consecutive patients with cerebrovascular diseases and NVAF that were treated with DE in a tertiary university hospital. Fibrinolysis and platelet function were assessed by thromboelastometry (ROTEM) and platelet function analyzer (PFA)-100, respectively, before and after treatment with DE. Conventional coagulation tests, endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) and hemoclot thrombin inhibitors (HTI), were also performed in order to detect any possible correlation between dabigatran plasma levels, its anticoagulant activity and the intensity of platelet dysfunction or fibrinolysis. A total of nineteen patients fulfilled our inclusion criteria (mean age 62.3±7.2years; 47% males; median CHADS2-score: 3; interquartile range: 2-4). DE treatment was associated with a significant reduction of the lysis index (LI60) at 60min (p=0.036), and prolongation of the PFA-100 CEPI closure time (p=0.024). After dabigatran treatment, abnormal PFA-100 results were obtained in two patients (11%, 95% CI: 2%-33%). DE levels (determined by HTI) were strongly inversely correlated (rho=-0.85; p<0.001) with the area under the curve (AUC) values in ETP assay. Νo association was found between HTI and PFA-100 CEPI CT (p=0.64), or LI60 measurements (p=0.60).",2015,"['Tsantes, Argirios E', 'Kyriakou, Elias', 'Bonovas, Stefanos', 'Chondrogianni, Maria', 'Zompola, Christina', 'Liantinioti, Chrissoula', 'Simitsi, Athina', 'Katsanos, Aristeidis H', 'Atta, Maria', 'Ikonomidis, Ignatios', 'Kapsimali, Violetta', 'Kopterides, Petros', 'Tsivgoulis, Georgios']"
Assessment of early thromboelastometric variables from extrinsically activated assays with and without aprotinin for rapid detection of fibrinolysis.,"Although thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) and thrombelastography can be used for bedside diagnosis of fibrinolysis, the time needed for detection is often prolonged. Since untreated fibrinolysis can result in consumption of coagulation factors and bleeding, early diagnosis and decision making are desirable. Accordingly, we assessed ROTEM variables from extrinsically activated assays with (APTEM) and without (EXTEM) addition of aprotinin for their ability to rapidly identify fibrinolysis. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that prolonged clotting time, clot formation time, low clot firmness (at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes, designated A5, A10, A15, and A20, respectively), low maximum clot firmness (MCF) in EXTEM assays, and differences in these variables from parallel APTEM and EXTEM assays (designated as Δvariables) predict fibrinolysis. Data from 411 thromboelastometric measurements (obtained from 352 patients) with fibrinolysis and from 2537 measurements without fibrinolysis (obtained from 1605 patients) were assessed and analyzed using receiver operating characteristics. Data were analyzed as a pooled fibrinolysis cohort, and subanalyses were performed from sets assigned to categories of fibrinolysis related to the timing of thrombus lysis (i.e., a decrease of clot firmness to <15% of MCF within 30, 45, and 60 minutes, respectively). A lower 95% confidence limit of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC [SE] <0.6) was considered a failure to substantially improve detection of increased fibrinolysis. AUCs were compared to identify the variable providing the best predictive association with fibrinolysis. As a secondary end point, optimum cutoff values at the point estimate corresponding to the greatest Youden index were calculated along with the respective sensitivities and specificities. In the pooled cohort, clot formation time (AUC: 0.652 [0.016]), α-angle (AUC: 0.675 [0.015]), A5 (AUC: 0.718 [0.013]), A10 (AUC: 0.734 [0.0.13]), A15 (AUC: 0.752 [0.013]), A20 (AUC: 0.771 [0.013]), and MCF (AUC: 0.799 [0.012]) predicted fibrinolysis. Fibrinolysis was also predicted by ΔA15 (AUC: 0.675 [0.016]), ΔA20 (AUC: 0.719 [0.015]), and ΔMCF (AUC: 0.812 [0.013]). AUCs increased in a time-related fashion. The ability to predict subsequent fibrinolysis based on thromboelastometry was higher when it occurred early rather than later during testing. However, for prediction of late fibrinolysis, only MCF (AUC: 0.655 [0.025]) appears to be potentially clinically useful.",2014,"['Dirkmann, Daniel', 'Görlinger, Klaus', 'Peters, Jürgen']"
Commercial single-walled carbon nanotubes effects in fibrinolysis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells.,"Recent studies have demonstrated that carbon nanotubes (CNTs) induce platelet aggregation, endothelial dysfunction and vascular thrombosis. However, there is little information on the effects of CNTs on fibrinolysis. We investigated the role of pristine-commercial single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with <3% Co content in fibrinolysis and their contribution to the induction of pro-thrombotic processes in human vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). SWCNTs alone produced concentration-dependent oxidation, as measured by a dithiothreitol oxidation assay. Internalized SWCNTs were located in HUVEC treated with 25 μg/ml using transmission electron microscopy, whereas treatment with 50 μg/ml compromised cell viability, and oxidative stress increased significantly at 5 μg/ml. The study showed that in HUVEC treated with 25 μg SWCNT/ml, fibrinolysis-related gene expression and protein levels had increased by 3-12 h after treatment (serpine-1: 13-fold; PLAT: 11-fold and PLAU: 2-fold), but only the PAI-1 protein was increased (1.5-fold), whereas tissue and urokinase plasminogen activator proteins (tPA and uPA, respectively) tended to decrease. In summary, pristine SWCNTs treatment resulted in evident HUVEC damage caused by cell fiber contact, internalization, and oxidative stress due to contaminant metals. The generation of endothelial dysfunction, as shown by the altered expression of genes and proteins involved in fibrinolysis, suggest that SWCNTs display pro-thrombotic effects.",2015,"['Rodríguez-Yáñez, Yury', 'Bahena-Uribe, Daniel', 'Chávez-Munguía, Bibiana', 'López-Marure, Rebeca', 'González-Monroy, Stuart', 'Cisneros, Bulmaro', 'Albores, Arnulfo']"
Monoclonal antibodies targeting the antifibrinolytic activity of activated thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor but not the anti-inflammatory activity on osteopontin and C5a.,"Recently, anti-thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) mAbs selectively inhibiting plasmin-mediated TAFI activation were shown to stimulate fibrinolysis in vitro and in vivo, suggesting, in contrast to other findings, that plasmin-mediated TAFI activation plays an important role in fibrinolysis regulation. To further characterize the effects of two plasmin-specific anti-TAFI mAbs (MA-TCK11A9 and MA-TCK26D6) on TAFI-dependent inhibition of fibrinolysis. Both mAbs inhibited plasmin-mediated but not thrombin/thrombomodulin-mediated TAFI activation, whereas neither inhibited the cleavage of hippuryl-arginine by activated TAFI (TAFIa). They stimulated tissue-type plasminogen activator-induced fibrinolysis in different clot lysis models through a TAFI-dependent mechanism, especially in the presence of thrombomodulin (TM), a condition in which TAFI is largely activated by the thrombin-TM complex. In a fibrinolysis-based TAFIa activity assay, both mAbs inhibited TAFIa, whereas other mAbs targeting thrombin-TM-mediated TAFI activation did not. The inhibition of TAFIa activity, however, was substrate-specific, because neither mAb inhibited the cleavage of thrombin-activated osteopontin and C5a by TAFIa, thus sparing the anti-inflammatory activity of TAFIa.",2013,"['Semeraro, F', 'Ammollo, C T', 'Gils, A', 'Declerck, P J', 'Colucci, M']"
Plasma is the physiologic buffer of tissue plasminogen activator-mediated fibrinolysis: rationale for plasma-first resuscitation after life-threatening hemorrhage.,"Prehospital resuscitation with crystalloid exacerbates fibrinolysis, which is associated with high mortality. We hypothesized that plasma compared with crystalloid resuscitation prevents hyperfibrinolysis in a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-rich environment via preservation of proteins essential for regulation of fibrinolysis. Healthy individuals donated blood, which was assayed using a native (nonactivated) thrombelastography (TEG). Whole-blood was mixed with normal saline (NS) or platelet poor plasma (PPP) at progressive dilutions. Tissue plasminogen activator was added to promote a fibrinolytic environment. In a separate experiment, PPP was run through a 100 kDa filter and liquid remaining on top of the filter (TFP) and below the filter (BFP) was obtained. Whole blood was diluted by 50% with TFP, BFP, and NS and assayed with a tPA TEG challenge. The TFP and BFP were assayed for protein concentration and protein composition. Normal saline and PPP dilution of whole blood without tPA did not affect clot lysis at 30 minutes (LY30) (NS Spearman's rho 0.300, p = 0.186 and PPP 0.294, p = 0.288). When tPA was added, NS dilution of whole blood increased LY30 in a percentage-dependent manner (0.844, p < 0.001), but did not significantly increase with PPP dilution (0.270, p = 0.202). The difference in LY30 from whole blood to diluted whole blood with PPP (mean change, -1.05, 95% CI, -9.42 to 7.33) was similar with TFP (1.23, 95% CI, -5.20 to 7.66, p = 0.992). However, both BFP (37.65, 95% CI 24.47 to 50.82, p = 0.001) and NS (47.36, 95% CI 34.3 to 60.45, p < 0.001) showed large increases in fibrinolysis compared with PPP.",2015,"['Moore, Hunter B', 'Moore, Ernest E', 'Gonzalez, Eduardo', 'Wiener, Gregory', 'Chapman, Michael P', 'Dzieciatkowska, Monika', 'Sauaia, Angela', 'Banerjee, Anirban', 'Hansen, Kirk C', 'Silliman, Christopher']"
Exercise stress testing enhances blood coagulation and impairs fibrinolysis in asymptomatic aortic valve stenosis.,"Increased thrombin formation and fibrin deposition on the valves were observed in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (AS). Exercise enhances blood coagulation and fibrinolysis in healthy subjects, but its haemostatic effects in AS are unknown. We sought to investigate how stress echocardiography alters blood coagulation and fibrinolysis in AS patients free of significant atherosclerotic vascular disease. We studied 32 consecutive asymptomatic moderate-to-severe AS patients and 32 age- and sex-matched controls. We measured peak thrombin generated using calibrated automated thrombogram, clot lysis time (CLT), and fibrinolytic markers at four time points, i.e. at rest, at peak exercise, and 1h and 24h after a symptom-limited exercise test. We observed that peak thrombin generated rose at peak exercise to 25% higher value in the patients than in controls (p<0.001) and reached its highest level 24h from exercise in AS patients while it decreased post-exercise in controls. Baseline CLT was 13% longer in AS patients (p=0.006) and associated with thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) activity (r=0.69, p<0.001), antiplasmin (r=0.47, p=0.007), and plasminogen (r=-0.55, p=0.001). In AS, CLT remained unaltered at peak exercise, while it decreased in controls, yielding the intergroup difference of 28% (p<0.001). Twenty-four hours after exercise CLT became 15% longer in AS patients (p<0.001). This hypofibrinolytic effect followed a similar pattern observed for TAFI activity.",2015,"['Kolasa-Trela, Renata', 'Fil, Korneliusz', 'Wypasek, Ewa', 'Undas, Anetta']"
Basic mechanisms and regulation of fibrinolysis.,"Fibrinolysis appears in many diverse physiological situations, and the components of the system are well established, along with mechanistic details for the individual reactions and some high-resolution structures. Key questions in understanding the regulation of fibrinolysis surround mechanisms of initiation and propagation, the localization of fibrinolysis reactions to the fibrin clot, and the influence of fibrin structure and clot composition on thrombolysis. This review covers these key areas with a focus on recent developments on fibrin structure and binding, the effects of a variety of cell types, the consequences of histones and DNA released by neutrophils, and the influence of flow. A complete understanding of the regulation of fibrinolysis will come from the building of detailed mathematical models. Suitable models are at an early stage of development, but may improve as model clots increase in complexity to incorporate the components and interactions listed above.",2015,"['Longstaff, C', 'Kolev, K']"
Assessment of Functional Fibrinolysis in Cord Blood Using Modified Thromboelastography.,"The fibrinolytic system in newborns is immature and probably impaired. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate functional fibrinolytic capacity of newborn's cord blood using a new thromboelastometry (rotational thromboelastogram, ROTEM®) test. Infants born at Sheba Medical Center were studied prospectively. Cord blood was obtained immediately after clumping, and ROTEM parameters were assessed applying non-activated TEM (NATEM) assay with increasing concentration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA, 0-200 U/ml). Baseline clotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT), alpha angle, and maximum clot firmness (MCF) were compared among infants versus adults. Each infant's demographic information was prospectively followed up until discharge. One hundred one newborns were tested. CT and CFT values were lower and alpha angles were higher among neonate's cord blood compared to adults (n = 23; P = 0.001, 0.03, and 0.02, respectively). The addition of tPA significantly shortened CT and CFT, and reduced alpha angles and MCF in both groups. The lysis index at 30 min (LI30) and lysis onset time (LOT) decreased significantly, and fibrinolysis was more rapid in the newborns. Hematocrit and platelet counts in neonates correlated with LI30 (P = 0.035 and 0.037, respectively) and LOT (P = 0.02) when higher tPA concentrations were used. ROTEM values were unrelated to the occurrence of postnatal complications.",2016,"['Sidlik, Rakefet', 'Strauss, Tzipora', 'Morag, Iris', 'Shenkman, Boris', 'Tamarin, Ilia', 'Lubetsky, Aharon', 'Livnat, Tami', 'Kenet, Gili']"
[Evaluation of fibrinolysis with streptokinase in ST-elevation myocardial infarction admitted to emergency department].,"Fibrinolysis during ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is feasible in the emergency departments (ED), and this reduces the delay from first medical contact to coronary reperfusion. The aim of the study is to: 1) Evaluate fibrinolysis with streptokinase (SK) in STEMI admitted to the ED. 2) identify clinical criteria predictive of fibrinolysis success. prospective study (July 2008-March 2012). Inclusion of STEMI thrombolysed by SK. Fibrinolysis success was defined according to clinical and Electrocardiogram criteria. Multivariate study is used to identify the factors associated with thrombolysis success. Out of the 329 STEMI enrolled during the study period, 224 (68%) were thrombolysed. Mean age = 57 ± 11 years (20-86 years) sex ratio = 6. The average time chest pain - emergency admission was 195 ± 177 min (15 min to 12 hours). The 2/3 of patients had consulted during the first 3 hours. The average success rate of thrombolysis was 59% and reached 83% the first hour, 66% the second hour and 58.7% the third hour. In multivariate analysis, the three independent predictors factors of a fibrinolysis success were: active smoking, current treatment with beta blockers and the delay from onset chest pain to the ED visit less than 180 min. Conversely, diabetes was associated with fibrinolysis failure. Fibrinolysis got complicated by two intracerebral hemorrhages.

Markers of inflammation and fibrinolysis in relation to outcome after surgery for lumbar disc herniation. A prospective study on 177 patients.,"The role of inflammation and fibrinolysis for the development of back pain and sciatica has been discussed. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between markers of inflammation and fibrinolysis, to predict the outcome after surgery for lumbar disc herniation. 177 patients were recruited. High sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), fibrinogen, and D-dimer were analyzed preoperatively. Visual analogue scale (VAS) for back and leg pain, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) were assessed preoperatively and at 6 weeks, 6-, 12-, and 24- months postoperatively. Dichotomization was made at the median for the laboratory analyses, and between the worst quartile and the other three quartiles for the outcome variables. Logistic regression was used to determine the odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI). The associations between PAI-1 and outcome seemed to be most prominent at the 6 and 12-month follow-up. When being in the upper half of PAI-1, the OR for being in the worst quartile of VAS back pain 12 months postoperatively was 3.33 (1.56-7.10). The corresponding OR for VAS leg pain was 2.46 (1.18-5.10), for ODI 2.83 (1.35-5.94) and for EQ-5D 2.73 (1.30-5.75). The OR for hsCRP was 2.10 (1.03-4.29) for being in the worst quartile of VAS back pain.

Growth hormone replacement normalizes impaired fibrinolysis: new insights into endothelial dysfunction in patients with hypopituitarism and growth hormone deficiency.,"Cardiovascular morbidity in adult patients with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and hypopituitarism is increased. Clustering of cardiovascular risk factors leading to endothelial dysfunction and impaired fibrinolysis has also been reported and may account for progression to overt vascular changes in these patients. However, effect of long lasting GH replacement therapy on fibrinolytic capacity in GH deficient patients has not been investigated so far. To investigate fibrinolysis before and after challenge with venous occlusion in GHD patients with hypopituitarism before and during one year of growth hormone replacement. Hospital based, interventional, prospective study. Twenty one patient with GHD and fourteen healthy control subjects matched for age, sex and body mass index (BMI). Anthropometric, metabolic and fibrinolytic parameters were measured at the start and after three, six and twelve months of treatment with human recombinant GH. At baseline GHD patients had significantly impaired fibrinolysis compared to healthy persons. During treatment with GH, significant changes were observed in insulin like growth factor 1(IGF-1) [from baseline 6.9(2.4-13.5) to 22.0(9.0-33.0) nmol/l after one month of treatment; p<0.01] and fibrinolysis. Improvement in fibrinolysis was mostly attributed to improvement of stimulated endothelial tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) release in response to venous occlusion [from baseline 1.1(0.4-2.6) to 1.9(0.5-8.8) after one year of treatment; p<0.01].",2013,"['Miljic, D', 'Miljic, P', 'Doknic, M', 'Pekic, S', 'Stojanovic, M', 'Cvijovic, G', 'Micic, D', 'Popovic, V']"
"Partial deletion of the αC-domain in the Fibrinogen Perth variant is associated with thrombosis, increased clot strength and delayed fibrinolysis.","Genetic fibrinogen (FGN) variants that are associated with bleeding or thrombosis may be informative about fibrin polymerisation, structure and fibrinolysis. We report a four generation family with thrombosis and heritable dysfibrinogenaemia segregating with a c.[1541delC];[=] variation in FGA (FGN-Perth). This deletion predicts a truncated FGN αC-domain with an unpaired terminal Cys at residue 517 of FGN-Aα. In keeping with this, SDS-PAGE of purified FGN-Perth identified a truncated FGN-Aα chain with increased co-purification of albumin, consistent with disulphide bonding to the terminal Cys of the variant FGN-Aα. Clot visco-elastic strength in whole blood containing FGN-Perth was greater than controls and tPA-mediated fibrinolysis was delayed. In FGN-Perth plasma and in purified FGN-Perth, there was markedly reduced final turbidity after thrombin-mediated clot generation. Consistent with this, FGN-Perth formed tighter, thinner fibrin fibres than controls indicating defective lateral aggregation of protofibrils. Clots generated with thrombin in FGN-Perth plasma were resistant to tPA-mediated fibrinolysis. FGN-Perth clot also displayed impaired tPA-mediated plasmin generation but incorporated α2-antiplasmin at a similar rate to control. Impaired fibrinolysis because of defective plasmin generation potentially explains the FGN-Perth clinical phenotype. These findings highlight the importance of the FGN αC-domain in the regulation of clot formation and fibrinolysis.",2013,"['Westbury, Sarah K', 'Duval, Cédric', 'Philippou, Helen', 'Brown, Rebecca', 'Lee, Kurtis R', 'Murden, Sherina L', 'Phillips, Emma', 'Reilly-Stitt, Christopher', 'Whalley, Daniel', 'Ariëns, Robert A', 'Mumford, Andrew D']"
The effective concentration of tranexamic acid for inhibition of fibrinolysis in neonatal plasma in vitro.,"Neonates are at high risk for bleeding complications after cardiovascular surgery. Activation of intravascular fibrinolysis is one of the principal effects of cardiopulmonary bypass that causes poor postoperative hemostasis. Antifibrinolytic medications such as tranexamic acid are often used as prophylaxis against fibrinolysis, but concentration/effect data to guide dosing are sparse for adults and have not been published for neonates. Higher concentrations of tranexamic acid than those necessary for inhibition of fibrinolysis may have adverse effects. Therefore, we investigated the concentration of tranexamic acid necessary to inhibit activated fibrinolysis in neonatal plasma. We conducted an in vitro study using neonatal plasma derived from the placenta/cord units from 20 term, elective cesarean deliveries. Graded concentrations of tranexamic acid were added to aliquots of the pooled plasma before maximally activating fibrinolysis with high-dose tissue-type plasminogen activator. Thromboelastography was then performed with the primary outcome variable being lysis at 30 minutes. These procedures were repeated on pooled adult normal plasma and dilutions of neonatal plasma. The minimum concentrations of tranexamic acid to completely prevent fibrinolysis were 6.54 μg/mL (95% confidence interval, 5.19-7.91) for neonatal plasma and 17.5 μg/mL (95% confidence interval, 14.59-20.41) for adult plasma. Neonatal plasma requires a significantly lower concentration than adult plasma (P < 0.0001, 2-sided Wald test).",2013,"['Yee, Branden E', 'Wissler, Richard N', 'Zanghi, Christine N', 'Feng, Changyong', 'Eaton, Michael P']"
Monitoring fibrinolysis in whole blood by viscoelastic instruments: a comparison of ROTEM and ReoRox.,"Increased fibrinolysis with the risk of bleeding is a consequence of thrombolytic therapy and can also be seen in clinical situations such as acute trauma. Thrombelastography and thrombelastometry are viscoelastic coagulation instruments that can detect higher degrees of fibrinolysis; hyperfibrinolysis. A newer viscoelastic instrument is the ReoRox, which uses free oscillation rheometry to detect clot formation, strength and fibrinolysis. The ReoRox has a new test for detection of fibrinolysis, called ReoLyse. The aim of this study was to compare ReoRox with its new ReoLyse test with rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM) in the monitoring of in vitro-induced fibrinolysis. Whole blood from 10 healthy volunteers was mixed with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) to obtain seven different plasma concentrations (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 3 and 5 μg/mL). Whole blood samples with the different t-PA plasma concentrations were analyzed with ROTEM EXTEM and FIBTEM tests, ReoRox standard test Fib1 (clot formation/strength) and ReoLyse (fibrinolysis) tests. The fibrinolysis variables with the best dose-response effect were the ReoRox ReoLyse lysis variables and ROTEM EXTEM Time to complete lysis. However, these variables only detected high t-PA levels (> 1 μg/mL).",2013,"['Nilsson, Caroline U', 'Tynngård, Nahreen', 'Reinstrup, Peter', 'Engström, Martin']"
"Influence of resuscitation fluids, fresh frozen plasma and antifibrinolytics on fibrinolysis in a thrombelastography-based, in-vitro, whole-blood model.","Hyperfibrinolysis has been identified as a mechanism of trauma coagulopathy associated with poor outcome. The aim of the study was to create a trauma coagulopathy model (TCM) with a hyperfibrinolysis thrombelastography (TEG) pattern similar to injured patients and test the effects of different resuscitation fluids and antifibrinolytics on fibrinolysis. TCM was established from whole blood by either 15% dilution with isotonic saline, lactated Ringer's, Plasma-Lyte, 5% albumin, Voluven, Hextend, 6% dextran in isotonic saline or 30% dilution with lactated Ringer's plus Voluven and supplementation with tissue factor and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). These combinations resulted in a TCM that could then be 'treated' with tranexamic acid (TXA) or 6-aminocaproic acid (ACA). Clot formation was evaluated by TEG. Whole-blood dilution by 15% with crystalloids and albumin in the presence of tissue factor plus tPA resulted in an abnormal TEG pattern and increased fibrinolysis, as did dilution with synthetic colloids. TXA 1 μg/ml or ACA 10 μg/ml were sufficient to suppress fibrinolysis when TCM was diluted 15% with lactated Ringer's, but 3 μg/ml of TXA or 30 μg/ml of ACA were needed for fibrinolysis inhibition induced by simultaneous euvolemic dilution with lactated Ringer's plus Voluven by 30%. A total of 15% dilution of whole blood in the presence of tissue factor plus tPA results in a hyperfibrinolysis TEG pattern similar to that observed in severely injured patients. Synthetic colloids worsen TEG variables with a further increase of fibrinolysis. Low concentrations of TXA or ACA reversed hyperfibrinolysis, but the efficient concentrations were dependent on the degree of fibrinolysis and whole-blood dilution.",2013,"['Kostousov, Vadim', 'Wang, Yao-Wei W', 'Cotton, Bryan A', 'Wade, Charles E', 'Holcomb, John B', 'Matijevic, Nena']"
[Recent progress and perspectives in the field of fibrinolysis].,"Employing newly developed imaging techniques, the spatio-temporal regulatory mechanism of fibrinolysis by platelets and vascular endothelial cells has been clarified. Upon activation, platelets release polyphosphate and inhibitors of fibrinolysis, and modify fibrin fibers which are relatively resistant to fibrinolysis. Platelets, in turn, initiate fibrinolysis. The details of the mechanism by which vascular endothelial cells (VECs) maintain high fibrinolytic potential, as well as how VECs develop anti-fibrinolytic activity, have also been clarified. These mechanisms as well as their modifications in response to inflammation are discussed herein. Newly developed drugs targeting fibrinolytic components are also introduced.",2016,"['Urano, Tetsumei', 'Suzuki, Yuko']"
Fibrinolysis status in the Budd-Chiari syndrome in China.,"Pathogenesis and clinical characteristics of the Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) in Asia are somewhat different from the ones observed in Western countries. Obstruction of the inferior vena cava (IVC) or of the hepatic veins is caused to a greater extent by membranous webs than by thrombosis. Impaired fibrinolysis has been found in European patients with BCS, but its status in Chinese patients with this condition is still unknown. To explore the characteristics of fibrinolysis in BCS patients in this country, we measured the euglobulin lysis time (ELT) for overall fibrinolysis and the plasma levels of five fibrinolytic components in 65 Chinese patients with BCS and 43 healthy controls. In patients, ELTs were slightly shorter than in controls (mean, 293 vs. 357 min, P < 0.02), tissue type plasminogen activator levels were higher than in controls (mean, 239 vs. 185 pg/ml, P < 0.01), and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 levels were lower than in controls (mean, 1.43 vs. 1.73 ng/ml, P < 0.001). To explore BCS in more detail, we subgrouped the cases according to age, type of venous occlusion, Child-Pugh score, and thrombosis. As a result of this analysis, we found that young patients (age <30 years) had a longer ELT (mean, 440 min) than the older patient groups (30 ≤ age ≤ 44, 45 ≤ age ≤ 54, age>54 years; mean ELT = 242, 198, and 289 min, respectively, all P < 0.05). The independent hepatic vein occlusion subgroup showed a longer ELT (mean, 367 min) than the combined hepatic vein and IVC or the independent IVC occlusion subgroup (mean ELT = 233 and 260 min, both P < 0.05). ELT did not show significant differences between Child-Pugh class A and B subgroups (mean, 267 vs. 333 min, P > 0.05). ELT in the subgroup without thrombosis was shorter than in controls (mean, 288 vs. 358 min, P < 0.05), and in the subgroup with thrombosis, it was also slightly shorter than in controls, without reaching statistical significance (mean, 306 vs. 358 min, P > 0.05). By and large, overall fibrinolytic potential was slightly increased in Chinese patients with BCS in this study, but fibrinolysis differed according to its baseline characteristics. Compared with the one seen in BCS patients from Western countries, BCS in China exhibits certain special changes in fibrinolysis and we were able to explain some of these changes.",2015,"['Ke, Zhang', 'Hao, Xu', 'Ning, Wei', 'Zu, Mao-heng', 'Fun, Yu-fei']"
The effects of 2-chloroprocaine on coagulation and fibrinolysis in the parturient: an in vitro study.,"Amide local anesthetics are known to inhibit coagulation. 2-chloroprocaine is the only ester agent used in obstetric anesthesia. It is used during obstetric emergencies, and also to supplement inadequate epidural block produced by amide local anesthetics. There is no study to date that has evaluated the effect of ester local anesthetics on blood coagulation and fibrinolysis in the parturient. In this study, we obtained blood samples from healthy, term-parturients and mixed them with varying amounts of 2-chloroprocaine for final concentrations ranging from 0.26 to 7.8 mM. Thromboelastograph(®) was used to study the coagulation profile of these samples. Chloroprocaine impaired coagulation in a dose dependent manner, with increased R and K, and decreased MA and α. The difference, when compared to saline controls, reached statistical significance at a dose of 7.8 mM.

Molecular mechanisms of the effect of ultrasound on the fibrinolysis of clots.,"Ultrasound accelerates tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA)-induced fibrinolysis of clots in vitro and in vivo. To identify mechanisms for the enhancement of t-PA-induced fibrinolysis of clots. Turbidity is an accurate and convenient method, not previously used, to follow the effects of ultrasound. Deconvolution microscopy was used to determine changes in structure, while fluorescence recovery after photobleaching was used to characterize the kinetics of binding/unbinding and transport. The ultrasound pulse repetition frequency affected clot lysis times, but there were no thermal effects. Ultrasound in the absence of t-PA produced a slight but consistent decrease in turbidity, suggesting a decrease in fibrin diameter due solely to the action of the ultrasound, likely caused by an increase in protofibril tension because of vibration from ultrasound. Changes in fibrin network structure during lysis with ultrasound were visualized in real time by deconvolution microscopy, revealing that the network becomes unstable when 30-40% of the protein in the network was digested, whereas without ultrasound, the fibrin network was digested gradually and retained structural integrity. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching during lysis revealed that the off-rate of oligomers from digesting fibers was little affected, but the number of binding/unbinding sites was increased.",2015,"['Chernysh, I N', 'Everbach, C E', 'Purohit, P K', 'Weisel, J W']"
Changes in fibrinolysis and severity of organ failure in sepsis: a prospective observational study using point-of-care test--ROTEM.,"We hypothesized that the thromboelastometry (ROTEM; Pentapharm GmbH, Munich, Germany) fibrinolysis parameter ""maximum lysis"" (ML) would have an independent inverse association with the severity of organ failure in sepsis. Selected adult patients with sepsis (n = 77) were recruited within 24 hours of antibiotic commencement. Patients with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score higher than 1 (n = 57) were followed for 72 hours. Prothrombin fragments 1 + 2, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (aPAI-1), ROTEM, and routine coagulation tests were measured daily along with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores. The activity of functional aPAI-1 increased with increasing severity of organ failure (P = .01) and was higher as compared with healthy controls (95% confidence interval, -65.4 to -29.9; P < .001). There was a decreasing trend in ML with increased organ failure (P = .001); however, there was no trend in d-dimer. Among all tests, only the lower ML (ß = -0.38, P < .001) and higher international normalized ratio (INR; ß = 0.32, P = .002) values significantly contributed to greater severity of organ failure (R(2) = 0.35, F2,73 = 19.29, P < .001). Despite an increase in INR, the prothrombin fragment remained unchanged (P = .89). Strong correlations were observed between early (24 hours) increase in fibrinolysis and recovery of organ failures for 48 hours (ML: r = 0.679, P = .001; aPAI-1: r = 0.694, P < .001).",2015,"['Prakash, Shivesh', 'Verghese, Santosh', 'Roxby, David', 'Dixon, Dani', 'Bihari, Shailesh', 'Bersten, Andrew']"
In-vitro study of homocysteine and aspirin effects on fibrinolysis: measuring fibrinolysis parameters.,"Some studies suggest that increased homocysteine in blood leads to alterations in coagulation and fibrinolysis; however, the precise mechanism is not clear. The aim of this study was to compare different concentrations of homocysteine and aspirin on fibrinolysis in the plasma of healthy individuals in vitro. Different concentrations of homocysteine (200, 100, and 50 μmol/l) and aspirin (100, 10, and 1 mg/l) were added to the healthy people plasma citrate. They were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Then, fibrinolysis parameters were analyzed by the turbidimetric procedure at 405 nm. The independent-samples t-test was utilized to compare them (P < 0.05). Findings revealed that homocysteine at 200 μmol/l with aspirin 100 ml/g had significant changes in the lysis maximum velocity (0.150 ± 0.002), half-lysis time (218 ± 5.77), the total lysis time (446 ± 5.77), and lag time in lysis (119 ± 3.60), compared to homocysteine at 200 μmol/l lysis maximum velocity (0.110 ± 0.002), half-lysis time (278 ± 7.63), the total lysis time (515 ± 14.29), and lag time in lysis (176 ± 3.60), respectively (P < 0.05). Homocysteine at 200 μmol/l with aspirin 1 ml/g did not significantly change in either parameter (P > 0.05). Homocysteine at 50 μmol/l with aspirin (100, 10, and 1 mg/l) had significant changes in all fibrinolysis parameters (P < 0.05), compared to homocysteine at 50 μmol/l.

Management of adjunctive antithrombotic therapy in STEMI patients treated with fibrinolysis undergoing rescue or delayed PCI.,"Although primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the recommended method of reperfusion in patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), fibrinolysis remains a beneficial alternative in patients who cannot be reperfused timely with primary PCI, and is still the preferred revascularisation strategy in many parts of the world where PCI facilities are unavailable. Because fibrinolysis is known to activate platelets and promote thrombin activity, concomitant administration of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies is needed to lower the risk for re-occlusion and to support mechanical interventions in patients undergoing rescue or delayed PCI. However, the addition of oral antiplatelet and parenteral anticoagulant drugs on top of fibrinolysis may come at the price of an increased risk of bleeding. The current availability of several antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies often leads to questions about the optimal selection in STEMI patients treated with fibrinolytics. This article appraises current evidences for the management of adjunctive antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies in patients with STEMI undergoing fibrinolysis followed by rescue or delayed PCI.",2015,"['Capodanno, Davide', 'Angiolillo, Dominick J']"
[Arginine and lysine as products of basic carboxypeptidase activity associated with fibrinolysis].,"Blood carboxypeptidases play an important role in the regulation of fibrinolysis. We have proposed here the method for the assay of blood carboxypeptidase activity associated with coagulation/fibrinolysis using the natural substrate fibrin and the detection of basic amino acids arginine and lysine as products in the conditions close to those in vivo. Plasma samples from 15 patients with arterial hypertension were investigated. The coagulation and subsequent fibrinolysis were initiated by addition of standard doses of thrombin and tissue plasminogen activator, respectively. Arginine and lysine concentrations before, during, and after completion of fibrinolysis were determined using HPLC. The parameters of fibrinolysis were evaluated by clot turbidity assay. Fibrinolysis led to a large and significant increase in concentrations of arginine and lysine in the incubation mixture by 101 and 81%, respectively. The duration of fibrinolysis initiation significantly correlated to the degree of increase of these amino acids: r(s) = -0.733 and -0.761 for arginine and lysine, respectively (p < 0.05). The rates of amino acids liberation during fibrinolysis demonstrate different pattern: arginine generation had two maximums: at the beginning of clot lysis and at his end, whereas the liberation of lysine occurred mainly at the middle of fibrinolysis. Thus, the carboxypeptidase activity associated with fibrinolysis can be considered as a local source of the essential aminoacids.",Error Retrieving,"['Zhloba, A A', 'Subbotina, T F', 'Lupan, D S', 'Bogova, V A', 'Kusheleva, O A']"
Ticagrelor versus high dose clopidogrel in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients with high platelet reactivity post fibrinolysis.,"Limited data are available on high platelet reactivity (HPR) rate early post fibrinolysis, while no effective way to overcome it has been proposed. In this context, we aimed to compare ticagrelor versus high dose clopidogrel in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who exhibit HPR post fibrinolysis. In a prospective, randomized, parallel design, 3-center study, 56 STEMI patients, out of 83 (67.5 %) screened, who presented with HPR (PRU ≥ 208 by VerifyNow) 3-48 h post fibrinolysis and prior to coronary angiography were allocated to ticagrelor 180 mg loading dose (LD)/90 mg bid maintenance dose (MD) or clopidogrel 600 mg LD/150 mg MD. Platelet reactivity was assessed at randomization (Hour 0), at Hour 2, Hour 24 and pre-discharge. The primary endpoint of platelet reactivity (in PRU) at Hour 2 was significantly lower for ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel with a least square mean difference (95 % confidence interval) of -141.7 (-173.4 to -109.9), p < 0.001. HPR rates at Hour 2 and 24 were significantly lower for ticagrelor versus clopidogrel (14.3 vs. 82.1 %, p < 0.001 and 0 vs. 25.0 %, p = 0.01 respectively), though not significantly different pre-discharge. In-hospital Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type ≥2 bleeding occurred in 1 and 2 clopidogrel and ticagrelor-treated patients, respectively. In STEMI patients, post fibrinolysis HPR is common.

Evaluation of tranexamic acid and ε-aminocaproic acid concentrations required to inhibit fibrinolysis in plasma of dogs and humans.,"To determine minimum plasma concentrations of the antifibrinolytic agents tranexamic acid (TEA) and ε-aminocaproic acid (EACA) needed to completely inhibit fibrinolysis in canine and human plasma after induction of hyperfibrinolysis. Pooled citrated plasma from 7 dogs and commercial pooled citrated human plasma. Concentrations of EACA from 0 μg/mL to 500 μg/mL and of TEA from 0 μg/mL to 160 μg/mL were added to pooled citrated canine and human plasma. Hyperfibrinolysis was induced with 1,000 units of tissue plasminogen activator/mL, and kaolin-activated thromboelastography was performed in duplicate. The minimum concentrations required to completely inhibit fibrinolysis 30 minutes after maximum amplitude of the thromboelastography tracing occurred were determined. Minimum plasma concentrations necessary for complete inhibition of fibrinolysis by EACA and TEA in pooled canine plasma were estimated as 511.7 μg/mL (95% confidence interval [CI], 433.2 to 590.3 μg/mL) and 144.7 μg/mL (95% CI, 125.2 to 164.2 μg/mL), respectively. Concentrations of EACA and TEA necessary for complete inhibition of fibrinolysis in pooled human plasma were estimated as 122.0 μg/mL (95% CI, 106.2 to 137.8 μg/mL) and 14.7 μg/mL (95% CI, 13.7 to 15.6 μg/mL), respectively.",2014,"['Fletcher, Daniel J', 'Blackstock, Kelly J', 'Epstein, Kira', 'Brainard, Benjamin M']"
In-vitro study of methylglyoxal and aspirin effects on fibrinolysis parameters.,"Methylglyoxal is a reactive α, β dicarbonyl aldehyde compound that originates from various biochemical pathways. Some studies suggest that increased methylglyoxal in blood leads to changes in fibrinolysis; however, the precise mechanism is not clear. The aim of this study was to compare different concentrations of methylglyoxal and aspirin on fibrinolysis in the plasma of healthy individuals in vitro. Different concentrations of methylglyoxal (5, 50, 100, and 500 μmol/l) and aspirin (1, 10, and 100 mg/l) were added to the plasma citrate. They were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Then, fibrinolysis parameters were analyzed by the turbidimetric procedure at 405 nm. The Independent Samples t-test was utilized to compare them (P < 0.05). Findings revealed that methylglyoxal at 500 μmol/l with aspirin 100 mg/l had significant changes in the maximum lysis velocity (0.163 ± 0.003), half-time lysis (240 ± 10.00), the total lysis time (485 ± 5.00), lag time in lysis (126 ± 5.77), compared with methylglyoxal at 500 μmol/l (0.104 ± 0.005), (276 ± 5.77), (570 ± 10.00), and (186 ± 5.77), respectively (P < 0.05). Methylglyoxal at 500 μmol/l with aspirin 1 mg/l did not significantly change in either parameter (P > 0.05). Methylglyoxal at 100 μmol/l with aspirin 1 mg/l did not significantly change in either fibrinolysis parameter (P > 0.05), compared with methylglyoxal at 100 μmol/l. Methylglyoxal at 5 μmol/l with aspirin (1, 10, 100  mg/l) changed in all fibrinolysis parameters (P < 0.05), compared with methylglyoxal at 5 μmol/l. The other concentrations were compared in the same way. Aspirin (more than 1 mg/l) had more effect on higher concentrations of methylglyoxal. It increased the velocity of lysis of the clot and shortened clot lysis.",2013,"['Pouya, Fahima D', 'Zavar-Reza, Javad', 'Jalali, Beman A']"
Platelets contain tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 derived from megakaryocytes and inhibits fibrinolysis.,"Tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2) is a homologue of TFPI-1 and contains three Kunitz-type domains and a basic C terminus region. The N-terminal domain of TFPI-2 is the only inhibitory domain, and it inhibits plasma kallikrein, factor XIa, and plasmin. However, plasma TFPI-2 levels are negligible (≤20 pM) in the context of influencing clotting or fibrinolysis. Here, we report that platelets contain significant amounts of TFPI-2 derived from megakaryocytes. We employed RT-PCR, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and confocal microscopy to determine that platelets, MEG-01 megakaryoblastic cells, and bone marrow megakaryocytes contain TFPI-2. ELISA data reveal that TFPI-2 binds factor V (FV) and partially B-domain-deleted FV (FV-1033) with K(d) ~9 nM and binds FVa with K(d) ~100 nM. Steady state analysis of surface plasmon resonance data reveal that TFPI-2 and TFPI-1 bind FV-1033 with K(d) ~36-48 nM and bind FVa with K(d) ~252-456 nM. Further, TFPI-1 (but not TFPI-1161) competes with TFPI-2 in binding to FV. These data indicate that the C-terminal basic region of TFPI-2 is similar to that of TFPI-1 and plays a role in binding to the FV B-domain acidic region. Using pull-down assays and Western blots, we show that TFPI-2 is associated with platelet FV/FVa. TFPI-2 (~7 nM) in plasma of women at the onset of labor is also, in part, associated with FV. Importantly, TFPI-2 in platelets and in plasma of pregnant women inhibits FXIa and tissue-type plasminogen activator-induced clot fibrinolysis. In conclusion, TFPI-2 in platelets from normal or pregnant subjects and in plasma from pregnant women binds FV/Va and regulates intrinsic coagulation and fibrinolysis.",2014,"['Vadivel, Kanagasabai', 'Ponnuraj, Sathya-Moorthy', 'Kumar, Yogesh', 'Zaiss, Anne K', 'Bunce, Matthew W', 'Camire, Rodney M', 'Wu, Ling', 'Evseenko, Denis', 'Herschman, Harvey R', 'Bajaj, Madhu S', 'Bajaj, S Paul']"
Role of fibrinolysis in sepsis.,"Sepsis, defined as infection-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome, invariably leads to hemostatic abnormalities ranging from insignificant coagulopathy to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The inflammation-induced activation of coagulation, the downregulation of physiologic anticoagulant pathways, and impairment of fibrinolysis play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of microvascular fibrin thrombosis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in DIC associated with sepsis. The balance between tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 mainly regulates fibrinolytic activity. Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor and neutrophil elastase also modulate fibrinolysis. Dynamic changes in these molecules are deeply involved in the pathomechanisms of the impairment of fibrinolysis, leading to MODS in DIC associated with sepsis. Evidence indicates that physical entrapment of bacteria by fibrin at the site of infection may limit their capacity to disseminate into nearby tissues, organs, and systemic circulation. Under this circumstance, impairment of fibrinolysis has protective role in the host defense. Given the protective and pathologic potential of fibrinolysis during sepsis, therapeutics that control DIC as a systemic syndrome, while maintaining the host defense at the infectious foci, are required for the protection against both the development of MODS and for the host defense mechanisms.",2013,"['Gando', 'Satoshi']"
Infusion of angiotensin II increases fibrinolysis in healthy individuals but not in patients with familial combined hyperlipidemia.,"Impaired fibrinolysis is related to insulin resistance, also a characteristic feature of familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL). The renin-angiotensin (Ang) system is upregulated with insulin resistance, and there is crosstalk between Ang II and insulin-signalling pathways. We studied the fibrinolytic effects of a 3-h systemic Ang II infusion in 16 patients with FCHL and 16 controls, and placebo infusion in eight individuals. Baseline plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity, plasmin-antiplasmin complex, insulin resistance and C-reactive protein were higher in patients with FCHL than in controls. PAI-1 activity decreased during Ang II, similar in patients with FCHL and controls, and by placebo. Plasmin-antiplasmin complex was unaffected by Ang II in FCHL but increased in controls. Patients with FCHL show signs of insulin resistance, low-grade inflammation and impaired fibrinolysis. Ang II enhances fibrinolysis in controls but not in patients with FCHL, suggesting that patients with FCHL are not capable of increasing tissue plasminogen activator activity in response to Ang II. Ang II has no short-term effects on PAI-1 activity.",2016,"['Ekholm, Mikael', 'Kahan, Thomas', 'Jörneskog, Gun', 'Bröijersén, Anders', 'Wallén, N Håkan']"
Fibrinolysis and the control of blood coagulation.,"Fibrin plays an essential role in hemostasis as both the primary product of the coagulation cascade and the ultimate substrate for fibrinolysis. Fibrinolysis efficiency is greatly influenced by clot structure, fibrinogen isoforms and polymorphisms, the rate of thrombin generation, the reactivity of thrombus-associated cells such as platelets, and the overall biochemical environment. Regulation of the fibrinolytic system, like that of the coagulation cascade, is accomplished by a wide array of cofactors, receptors, and inhibitors. Fibrinolytic activity can be generated either on the surface of a fibrin-containing thrombus, or on cells that express profibrinolytic receptors. In a widening spectrum of clinical disorders, acquired and congenital defects in fibrinolysis contribute to disease morbidity, and new assays of global fibrinolysis now have potential predictive value in multiple clinical settings. Here, we summarize the basic elements of the fibrinolytic system, points of interaction with the coagulation pathway, and some recent clinical advances.",2015,"['Chapin, John C', 'Hajjar, Katherine A']"
Fibrinolysis and proliferative endarteritis: two related processes in chronic infections? The model of the blood-borne pathogen Dirofilaria immitis.,"The interaction between blood-borne pathogens and fibrinolysis is one of the most important mechanisms that mediate invasion and the establishment of infectious agents in their hosts. However, overproduction of plasmin (final product of the route) has been related in other contexts to proliferation and migration of the arterial wall cells and degradation of the extracellular matrix. We have recently identified fibrinolysis-activating antigens from Dirofilaria immitis, a blood-borne parasite whose key pathological event (proliferative endarteritis) is produced by similar mechanisms to those indicated above. The objective of this work is to study how two of this antigens [actin (ACT) and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (FBAL)] highly conserved in pathogens, activate fibrinolysis and to establish a relationship between this activation and the development of proliferative endarteritis during cardiopulmonary dirofilariasis. We demonstrate that both proteins bind plasminogen, enhance plasmin generation, stimulate the expression of the fibrinolytic activators tPA and uPA in endothelial cell cultures and are located on the surface of the worm in contact with the host's blood. ELISA, western blot and immunofluorescence techniques were employed for this purpose. Additionally, the implication of lysine residues in this interaction was analyzed by bioinformatics. The involvement of plasmin generated by the ACT/FBAL and plasminogen binding in cell proliferation and migration, and degradation of the extracellular matrix were shown in an ""in vitro"" model of endothelial and smooth muscle cells in culture. The obtained results indicate that ACT and FBAL from D. immitis activate fibrinolysis, which could be used by the parasite like a survival mechanism to avoid the clot formation. However, long-term overproduction of plasmin can trigger pathological events similar to those described in the emergence of proliferative endarteritis. Due to the high degree of evolutionary conservation of these antigens, similar processes may occur in other blood-borne pathogens.",2015,"['González-Miguel, Javier', 'Morchón, Rodrigo', 'Siles-Lucas, Mar', 'Simón, Fernando']"
Simultaneous measurement of thrombin and plasmin generation to assess the interplay between coagulation and fibrinolysis.,"Normal haemostasis is maintained by a controlled balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis, involving thrombin and plasmin the respective key enzymes. Simultaneous evaluation of both enzymes facilitates, therefore, an overall understanding of normal and pathological haemostasis. Combined thrombin and plasmin generation (T/P-G) assays have been recently described, and we have adapted the technique to investigate the interplay between coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with various haemostatic disorders. Our modified T/P-G was initiated by the addition of a mixture of optimised lower concentrations of tissue factor and tissue-type plasminogen activator. Thrombin generation (TG) and plasmin generation (PG) were monitored simultaneously using individual fluorescent substrates in separate microtitre wells. The relationship between coagulation and fibrinolysis was demonstrated by analysing the effects of thrombin inhibitors, activated protein C and thrombomodulin. The most evident impairments in TG were observed with plasma samples deficient of coagulation factors participating in the prothrombinase complex. Defects in PG were observed with deficiencies of factor (F)V, FX, fibrinogen, and plasminogen. TG appeared to be a prerequisite for the initiation of PG, and overall PG was governed by fibrinogen concentration. TG in patients with haemophilia A correlated with levels of FVIII activity, but there was no significant relationship between PG and FVIII:C, confirming that the abnormal haemostasis in haemophilia A results in a severe imbalance between coagulation and fibrinolysis. The findings demonstrate that global haemostasis depends on a sensitive balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis, and that the modified T/P-G assay could provide an enhanced understanding of haemorrhage and thrombosis in clinical practice.",2013,"['Matsumoto, Tomoko', 'Nogami, Keiji', 'Shima, Midori']"
"Prothrombotic state and impaired fibrinolysis in bullous pemphigoid, the most frequent autoimmune blistering disease.","Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a potentially life-threatening autoimmune blistering disease that is burdened with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. In BP, there is an interplay between inflammation and coagulation both locally, which contributes to skin damage, and systemically, which leads to a prothrombotic state. Fibrinolysis is an important defence mechanism against thrombosis, but has only been studied locally in BP and no systemic data are available. The aim of this observational study was to evaluate systemic fibrinolysis and coagulation activation in patients with BP. We measured parameters of fibrinolysis and coagulation by immunoenzymatic methods in plasma from 20 patients with BP in an active phase and during remission after corticosteroid treatment. The controls were 20 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. Plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) antigen, PAI-1 activity and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen were significantly higher in the BP patients with active disease than in healthy controls (P = 0·0001 for all), as were the plasma levels of the fibrin fragment d-dimer and prothrombin fragment F1+2 (P = 0·0001 for both). During remission after treatment, levels of PAI-1 antigen and PAI-1 activity decreased significantly (P = 0·008 and P = 0·006, respectively), and there was also a significant decrease in plasma levels of d-dimer (P = 0·0001) and F1+2 (P = 0·0001). Fibrinolysis is inhibited in patients with active BP, due mainly to an increase in plasma levels of PAI-1. Corticosteroids not only induce the regression of BP lesions, but also reduce the inhibition of fibrinolysis, which may contribute to decreasing thrombotic risk.",2013,"['Marzano, A V', 'Tedeschi, A', 'Polloni, I', 'Crosti, C', 'Cugno, M']"
Activity of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor in the plasma of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm.,"Patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) experience impaired balance between fibrinolysis and coagulation, manifested by increased prothrombotic tendency and intensified inflammatory processes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the TAFI activity level (thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor) in the plasma of AAA patients. Plasma levels of PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1), urokinase-type plasminogen activator and uPAR (urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor) were measured as markers of fibrinolytic activity. The study showed that the activity of the thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor in the plasma of AAA patients was significantly lower than in the plasma of the control individuals (64.6 ± 10.1 vs. 54.2 ± 10.9%, P < 0.0001). TAFI activity positively correlated with the white blood cell count (r = 0.486, P < 0.005). The uPAR concentration in the AAA patients was statistically significantly higher than in the control group and positively correlated with TAFI activity (r = 0.409, P = 0.02). The levels of PAI-1 and D-dimers (fibrin fragments) were significantly higher in patients with AAA than in the control group (44.3 ± 17.5 vs. 21.7 ± 8.7 ng/ml and 1869.6 ± 1490.1 vs. 181.5 ± 188.6 ng/ml, respectively). Lowered activity of the fibrinolysis inhibitor TAFI may heighten the blood fibrinolytic potential in AAA patients and contribute to the development of comorbidities. Therefore, TAFI participation in AAA pathogenesis cannot be excluded.",2014,"['Dubis, Joanna', 'Zuk, Natalia', 'Grendziak, Ryszard', 'Zapotoczny, Norbert', 'Pfanhauser, Monika', 'Witkiewicz, Wojciech']"
Fibrinolysis in normal vitreous liquid.,"Plasmin is the key enzyme of fibrinolysis. Plasmin-alpha2-antiplasmin (PAP) complexes are biomarkers of fibrinolysis activation. The purpose of our investigation was to evaluate the activity of fibrinolysis in normal human eyes, that is in eyes without blood-retina barrier breakdown (BRB), which has not been investigated so far. Twenty-two vitreal samples were harvested at the beginning of a standard 23-gauge three-port pars plana vitrectomy for macular pucker removal, macular hole closure or vitreal floater removal from the central vitreous body. These samples were immediately stabilized with human albumin (2.5% final conc.) and arginine (1.25 mmol/l final conc.) and subsequently frozen. Plasminogen was functionally determined in an ultra-sensitive pNA reaction after activation with streptokinase (100% = functional plasminogen in pooled normal citrated plasma). PAP concentrations were measured by enzyme immune assay (EIA). Intravitreal functional plasminogen exhibited to be 1 ± 0.65% (range: 0.2-2.49%). PAP concentrations ranged at levels of 14 ± 9ng/ml (range: 2-33 ng/ml). Pearson's correlation quotient between functional plasminogen and PAP revealed to be r equal to -0.27 (P = 0.221). No adverse events or serious side effects occurred. Sampling vitreous fluid at the beginning of a standard 23-gauge three-port pars plana vitrectomy is a well tolerated procedure. A strict stabilization procedure for extracted vitreous specimen is necessary to obtain activities and concentrations that are close to the true intraocular value. There is a basal intraocular fibrinolysis, a possible target for intravitreal pharmacological therapy.",2014,"['Bertelmann, Thomas', 'Stief, Thomas', 'Bölöni, Reka', 'Schulze, Stephan', 'Wenner, Yaroslava', 'Sekundo, Walter', 'Mennel, Stefan']"
Elevated thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor levels in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate plasma concentrations of thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) in relation with hormonal, metabolic, and hemostatic profile in patients with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). A total of 38 women with PCOS and 37 age and body mass index (BMI) matched controls were eligible for the study. Hirsutism scores, hormonal, metabolic, and hemostatic profile as well as TAFI levels were evaluated in each subject. Women with PCOS exhibited higher plasma concentrations of TAFI levels than controls (107.42 ± 34.77% versus 91.86 ± 23.88%, p = 0.027). TAFI levels were significantly correlated positively with BMI, fasting insulin levels, modified Ferriman Gallwey scores and Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) index, systolic blood pressure, and waist and hip circumferences, whereas negatively correlated with activated partial thromboplastin time (p < 0.05). However, after adjustment for all possible confounding factors, none of the parameters was significantly deterministic on TAFI levels.",2015,"['Güldaş, Metin', 'Altinkaya, Sündüz Özlem', 'Nergiz, Sümeyra', 'Demircan-Sezer, Selda', 'Yüksel, Hasan']"
Coagulation and fibrinolysis activation after single-incision versus standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a single-center prospective case-controlled pilot study.,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with attenuated acute-phase response and hypercoagulable state compared with the open procedure. Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a new technique aiming to minimize the invasiveness of the procedure. By comparing the degree of coagulation and fibrinolysis activation after conventional multiport (CLC) and single-incision (SILC) laparoscopic cholecystectomy, we aimed to determine whether the reduced incision size induces a lower thrombophilic tendency. Thirty-two adult patients with noncomplicated symptomatic cholelithiasis were nonrandomly assigned to CLC or SILC. Prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2), thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT), D-dimers, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor levels were measured at baseline, at 1st, and 24th hour, postoperatively. Twenty-six patients were finally included in the study. Fifteen patients underwent CLC (male/female: 5/10) and 11 underwent SILC (male/female: 1/10). There were no perioperative complications. An almost similar postoperative pattern and degree of activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways was noted in both groups. No statistically significant differences were found between SILC and CLC for F1 + 2, TAT, D-dimers, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor levels, duration of surgery, length of hospital stay, and postoperative morbidity. A similar pattern and extent of coagulation and fibrinolysis activation is present in SILC and CLC, and therefore there is no difference in tendency for thrombosis. Thromboembolic prophylaxis should be considered in SILC as recommended for CLC, pharmacologic or mechanical, considering the hemorrhagic risk and the presence of additional thromboembolism risk factors. SILC appears to be a safe, feasible technique that can be recommended for its potential advantages in cosmesis and reduced incisional pain.",2014,"['Zezos, Petros', 'Christoforidou, Anna', 'Kouklakis, Georgios', 'Tsalikidis, Christos', 'Dimakis, Constantinos', 'Laftsidis, Prodromos', 'Virgiliou, Andriana', 'Simopoulos, Constantinos', 'Pitiakoudis, Michail']"
Insights into thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor function and regulation.,"Fibrinolysis is initiated when the zymogen plasminogen is converted to plasmin via the action of plasminogen activators. Proteolytic cleavage of fibrin by plasmin generates C-terminal lysine residues capable of binding both plasminogen and the plasminogen activator, thereby stimulating plasminogen activator-mediated plasminogen activation and propagating fibrinolysis. This positive feedback mechanism is regulated by activated thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFIa), which cleaves C-terminal lysine residues from the fibrin surface, thereby decreasing its cofactor activity. TAFI can be activated by thrombin alone, but the rate of activation is accelerated when in complex with thrombomodulin. Plasmin is also known to activate TAFI. TAFIa has no known physiologic inhibitors and consequently, its primary regulatory mechanism involves its intrinsic thermal instability. The rate of TAFI activation and stability of the active form, TAFIa, function in maintaining its concentration above the threshold value required to down-regulate fibrinolysis. Although all methods to quantify TAFI or TAFIa have their limitations, epidemiologic studies have indicated that elevated TAFI levels are correlated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. Major efforts have been made to develop TAFI inhibitors that can either directly interfere with TAFIa activity or impair its activation. However, the anti-inflammatory properties of TAFIa might complicate the development and application of a TAFIa inhibitor that aims to increase the efficiency of thrombolytic therapy.",2013,"['Foley, J H', 'Kim, P Y', 'Mutch, N J', 'Gils, A']"

Estriol-induced fibrinolysis due to the activation of plasminogen to plasmin by nitric oxide synthesis in platelets.,"Estriol, an oestrogen, at 0.6 nmol/l was reported to inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation through nitric oxide synthesis. As nitric oxide has been reported to cause fibrinolysis due to the activation of plasminogen to plasmin, the role of estriol as a fibrinolytic agent was investigated. Also, the mechanism of estriol-induced nitric oxide synthesis in anucleated platelets was investigated. The estriol-induced lysis of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) clot was determined by photography of the clot lysis and by the assay of fibrin degradation products in the lysate and was obtained by SDS-PAGE. Nitric oxide was determined by methemoglobin method. The platelet membrane protein was isolated from the platelets by using Triton X-100 (0.05% v/v). The binding of estriol to the protein was determined by Scatchard plot by using an ELISA for estriol. Estriol at 0.6 nmol/l was found to lyse the clotted PRP due to fibrinolysis that produced fibrin degradation products in the lysate. The amino acid analysis of the platelet membrane protein, which resembles with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, was activated nearly 10-fold over the control in the presence of estriol and was identified to be a human serum albumin precursor (Mr. 69 kDa) that binds to estriol with Kd1 of 6.0 × 10 mol/l and 39 ± 2 molecules of estriol bound the NOS molecule. The estriol-induced nitric oxide is capable of inducing fibrinolysis of the clotted PRP. The binding of estriol to platelet membrane NOS activated the enzyme in the absence of DNA in the platelet.",2015,"['Jana, Pradipta', 'Maiti, Smarajit', 'Kahn, Nighat N', 'Sinha, Asru K']"
Regulation of fibrinolysis by C-terminal lysines operates through plasminogen and plasmin but not tissue-type plasminogen activator.,"Binding of tissue-type plasminogen (Pgn) activator (t-PA) and Pgn to fibrin regulates plasmin generation, but there is no consistent, quantitative understanding of the individual contribution of t-PA finger and kringle 2 domains to the regulation of fibrinolysis. Kringle domains bind to lysines in fibrin, and this interaction can be studied by competition with lysine analogs and removal of C-terminal lysines by carboxypeptidase B (CPB). High-throughput, precise clot lysis assays incorporating the lysine analog tranexamic acid (TA) or CPB and genetically engineered variants of t-PA were performed. In particular, wild-type (WT) t-PA (F-G-K1-K2-P) and a domain-switched variant K1K1t-PA (F-G-K1-K1-P) that lacks kringle 2 but retains normal t-PA structure were compared to probe the importance of fibrin lysine binding by t-PA kringle 2. WT t-PA showed higher rates of fibrinolysis than K1K1t-PA, but the inhibitory effects of TA or CPB were very similar for WT t-PA and the variant t-PA (< 10% difference). Urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA)-catalyzed fibrinolysis was also inhibited by TA, even though Pgn activation could be stimulated. Fibrin treated with factor XIIIa (FXIIIa) generates crosslinked degradation products, but these did not affect the results obtained with WT t-PA and K1K1t-PA.",2012,"['Silva, M M C G', 'Thelwell, C', 'Williams, S C', 'Longstaff, C']"
Effects of extracellular DNA on plasminogen activation and fibrinolysis.,"The increased levels of extracellular DNA found in a number of disorders involving dysregulation of the fibrinolytic system may affect interactions between fibrinolytic enzymes and inhibitors. Double-stranded (ds) DNA and oligonucleotides bind tissue-(tPA) and urokinase (uPA)-type plasminogen activators, plasmin, and plasminogen with submicromolar affinity. The binding of enzymes to DNA was detected by EMSA, steady-state, and stopped-flow fluorimetry. The interaction of dsDNA/oligonucleotides with tPA and uPA includes a fast bimolecular step, followed by two monomolecular steps, likely indicating slow conformational changes in the enzyme. DNA (0.1-5.0 μg/ml), but not RNA, potentiates the activation of Glu- and Lys-plasminogen by tPA and uPA by 480- and 70-fold and 10.7- and 17-fold, respectively, via a template mechanism similar to that known for fibrin. However, unlike fibrin, dsDNA/oligonucleotides moderately affect the reaction between plasmin and α(2)-antiplasmin and accelerate the inactivation of tPA and two chain uPA by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which is potentiated by vitronectin. dsDNA (0.1-1.0 μg/ml) does not affect the rate of fibrinolysis by plasmin but increases by 4-5-fold the rate of fibrinolysis by Glu-plasminogen/plasminogen activator. The presence of α(2)-antiplasmin abolishes the potentiation of fibrinolysis by dsDNA. At higher concentrations (1.0-20 μg/ml), dsDNA competes for plasmin with fibrin and decreases the rate of fibrinolysis. dsDNA/oligonucleotides incorporated into a fibrin film also inhibit fibrinolysis. Thus, extracellular DNA at physiological concentrations may potentiate fibrinolysis by stimulating fibrin-independent plasminogen activation. Conversely, DNA could inhibit fibrinolysis by increasing the susceptibility of fibrinolytic enzymes to serpins.",2011,"['Komissarov, Andrey A', 'Florova, Galina', 'Idell, Steven']"
Addition of Arsenic Trioxide into Induction Regimens Could Not Accelerate Recovery of Abnormality of Coagulation and Fibrinolysis in Patients with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia.,"All-trans retinoic acid combined to anthracycline-based chemotherapy is the standard regimen of acute promyelocytic leukemia. The advent of arsenic trioxide has contributed to improve the anti-leukemic efficacy in acute promyelocytic leukemia. The objectives of the current study were to evaluate if dual induction by all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide could accelerate the recovery of abnormality of coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Retrospective analysis was performed in 103 newly-diagnosed patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Hemostatic variables and the consumption of component blood were comparably analyzed among patients treated by different induction regimen with or without arsenic trioxide. Compared to patients with other subtypes of de novo acute myeloid leukemia, patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia had lower platelet counts and fibrinogen levels, significantly prolonged prothrombin time and elevated D-dimers (P<0.001). Acute promyelocytic leukemia patients with high or intermediate risk prognostic stratification presented lower initial fibrinogen level than that of low-risk group (P<0.05). After induction treatment, abnormal coagulation and fibrinolysis of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia was significantly improved before day 10. The recovery of abnormal hemostatic variables (platelet, prothrombin time, fibrinogen and D-dimer) was not significantly accelerated after adding arsenic trioxide in induction regimens; and the consumption of transfused component blood (platelet and plasma) did not dramatically change either. Acute promyelocytic leukemia patients with high or intermediate risk prognostic stratification had higher platelet transfusion demands than that of low-risk group (P<0.05).",2016,"['Zhang, Ye', 'Wu, SiJing', 'Luo, Dan', 'Zhou, JianFeng', 'Li, DengJu']"

There is a need to understand the efficacy and safety of this procedure because it shows promise. We aim to assess the effects of intrapericardial fibrinolysis in the treatment of pericardial effusion. We will search PubMed, the Cochrane Library, African Journals online, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Trip database, Clinical trials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for studies that evaluate the efficacy and/or safety of complete pericardial fluid drainage by intrapericardial fibrinolysis irrespective of study design, geographical location, language, age of participants, aetiology of pericarditis or types of fibrinolytics. Two authors will do the search independently, screen the search outputs for potentially eligible studies and assess whether the studies meet the inclusion criteria. Discrepancies between the two authors will be resolved through discussion and arbitration by a third author. Data from the selected studies shall be extracted using a standardised data collection form which will be piloted before use. The methodological quality of studies will be assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tools for assessing risk of bias for experimental studies and non-randomised studies, respectively. The primary meta-analysis will use random effects models due to expected interstudy heterogeneity. Dichotomous data will be analysed using relative risk and continuous with data mean differences, both with 95% CIs. Approval by an ethics committee is not required for this study as it is a protocol for a systematic review of published studies. The results will be disseminated through a conference presentation and peer-reviewed publication.",2016,"['Kakia, Aloysious', 'Wiysonge, Charles S', 'Ochodo, Eleanor A', 'Awotedu, Abolade A', 'Ristic, Arsen D', 'Mayosi, Bongani M']"
Matrix metalloproteinase-10 effectively reduces infarct size in experimental stroke by enhancing fibrinolysis via a thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor-mediated mechanism.,"The fibrinolytic and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) systems cooperate in thrombus dissolution and extracellular matrix proteolysis. The plasminogen/plasmin system activates MMPs, and some MMPs have been involved in the dissolution of fibrin by targeting fibrin(ogen) directly or by collaborating with plasmin. MMP-10 has been implicated in inflammatory/thrombotic processes and vascular integrity, but whether MMP-10 could have a profibrinolytic effect and represent a promising thrombolytic agent is unknown. The effect of MMP-10 on fibrinolysis was studied in vitro and in vivo, in MMP-10-null mice (Mmp10(-/-)), with the use of 2 different murine models of arterial thrombosis: laser-induced carotid injury and ischemic stroke. In vitro, we showed that MMP-10 was capable of enhancing tissue plasminogen activator-induced fibrinolysis via a thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor inactivation-mediated mechanism. In vivo, delayed fibrinolysis observed after photochemical carotid injury in Mmp10(-/-) mice was reversed by active recombinant human MMP-10. In a thrombin-induced stroke model, the reperfusion and the infarct size in sham or tissue plasminogen activator-treated animals were severely impaired in Mmp10(-/-) mice. In this model, administration of active MMP-10 to wild-type animals significantly reduced blood reperfusion time and infarct size to the same extent as tissue plasminogen activator and was associated with shorter bleeding time and no intracranial hemorrhage. This effect was not observed in thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor-deficient mice, suggesting thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor inactivation as one of the mechanisms involved in the MMP-10 profibrinolytic effect.",2011,"['Orbe, J', 'Barrenetxe, J', 'Rodriguez, J A', 'Vivien, D', 'Orset, C', 'Parks, W C', 'Birkland, T P', 'Serrano, R', 'Purroy, A', 'Martinez de Lizarrondo, S', 'Angles-Cano, E', 'Páramo, J A']"
Thrombosis in systemic lupus erythematosus: role of impaired fibrinolysis.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that can affect any part of the body, including the skin, liver, kidneys, and blood. Thrombosis is a frequent manifestation in SLE, contributing significantly to patient morbidity and mortality, although the precise mechanism(s) of how this occurs remains unclear. Fibrinolysis is the physiologic process of thrombus digestion and provides an important balance to hemostasis. This process is triggered upon vessel injury with the release of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) from endothelial cells. The central component of the fibrinolytic pathway is plasminogen, a zymogen that is converted to plasmin by t-PA. Plasminogen/plasmin is absorbed into the developing thrombus and digests fibrinogen and fibrin within the hemostatic plug to prevent excessive clot formation. Abnormalities of the fibrinolytic pathway are associated either with the development of thrombosis (impaired fibrinolysis) or, to a lesser extent, bleeding (excessive fibrinolysis). Indeed, impaired fibrinolysis has been reported in patients with SLE and may contribute to both the development of hypercoagulability and an increased risk of thrombosis. Here we discuss the role of impaired fibrinolysis and its contribution to hypercoagulability and thrombosis in SLE.",2013,"['Dhillon, Parvinderjit K', 'Adams, Murray J']"
A novel hemostasis assay for the simultaneous measurement of coagulation and fibrinolysis.,"Thrombin and plasmin are the key enzymes involved in coagulation and fibrinolysis. A novel hemostasis assay (NHA) was developed to measure thrombin and plasmin generation in a single well by a fluorimeter. The NHA uses two fluorescent substrates with non-interfering fluorescent excitation and emission spectra. The assay was tested in vitro using modulators like heparin, hirudin, epsilon-aminocaproic acid, gly-pro-arg-pro peptide and reptilase and validated by measurement of prothrombin fragment 1+2 and plasmin-alpha2-antiplasmin levels. Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were < 9% and 6-25%, respectively. Interplay between coagulation and fibrinolysis was demonstrated by the effect of tissue-type plasminogen activator on thrombin generation and by the different responses of activated protein C and thrombomodulin on fibrinolysis. The last responses showed the linkage between coagulation and fibrinolysis by thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor. In conclusion, this strategy allows detection of coagulation, fibrinolysis and their interplay in a single assay.",2011,"['van Geffen, Mark', 'Loof, Arnoud', 'Lap, Paul', 'Boezeman, Jan', 'Laros-van Gorkom, Britta A P', 'Brons, Paul', 'Verbruggen, Bert', 'van Kraaij, Marian', 'van Heerde, Waander L']"
"The in-vitro effect of fibrinogen, factor XIII and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor on clot formation and susceptibility to tissue plasminogen activator-induced fibrinolysis in hemodilution model.","Patients suffering major traumatic or surgical bleeding are often exposed to hemodilution resulting in dilutional coagulopathy. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the effects of fibrinogen, factor XIII and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) on clot formation and resistance to fibrinolysis in hemodilution conditions. Citrated whole blood from 36 healthy volunteers was diluted to 30 and 60% with lactated Ringer's solution. Blood samples were subsequently supplemented with fibrinogen, FXIII, TAFI or their combinations. Rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM) in whole blood and thrombin generation in plasma were performed in the presence of CaCl₂ and tissue factor/EXTEM reagent, and fibrinolysis was induced by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Hemodilution was expressed by decrease of peak height in thrombin generation and α-angle and maximum clot firmness (MCF) in ROTEM. Fibrinogen, FXIII or TAFI did not correct the decrease in thrombin generation peak height. In ROTEM, spiking of diluted blood with fibrinogen stimulated clot propagation. In tPA-treated blood fibrinogen, FXIII and TAFI increased clot firmness and inhibited fibrinolysis. Stronger protection against fibrinolysis was achieved combining FXIII with TAFI. Hemodilution was associated with inhibition of thrombin generation; however, this effect was not sensitive to blood spiking with fibrinogen, FXIII and TAFI. In ROTEM, these hemostasis agents improved clot strength and decreased clot susceptibility to tPA in nondiluted and to more extent in diluted blood. The maximal protection against fibrinolysis was caused by TAFI. Combining FXIII with TAFI exerted synergistic inhibitory effect on fibrinolysis.",2012,"['Shenkman, Boris', 'Livnat, Tami', 'Lubetsky, Aharon', 'Tamarin, Ilia', 'Budnik, Ivan', 'Einav, Yulia', 'Martinowitz, Uriel']"
"Pre-hospital fibrinolysis in the management of patients with ST elevation acute coronary syndrome: review of the evidence, implementation and future directions.","Time to reperfusion is among the strongest predictors of clinical outcome in patients who present with ST elevation acute myocardial infarction. When time to access is equivalent, primary percutaneous coronary intervention has demonstrated superior outcomes to fibrinolysis. However, where significant delays exist in accessing percutaneous intervention, fibrinolysis has an important role. The potential for fibrinolysis delivery in the pre-hospital setting means that delays to primary percutaneous intervention need to be considered from the time that the patient becomes eligible for fibrinolysis in the field. This can be particularly challenging in patients with symptom duration ofless than two hours, as some evidence suggests fibrinolysis may be particularly beneficial in this early phase. Additionally, access to primary percutaneous intervention provided by an experienced operator, in a timely manner at any time of the day or night, is not an available option in many healthcare settings. This review focuses on the current evidence and practice of pre-hospital fibrinolysis and assesses potential roles for this therapy in the future.",2013,"['Camuglia, A C', 'Luis, S A', 'Sengupta, A', 'Bett, J H N', 'Walters, D L']"
"D-dimer: An Overview of Hemostasis and Fibrinolysis, Assays, and Clinical Applications.","D-dimer is the smallest fibrinolysis-specific degradation product found in the circulation. The origins, assays, and clinical use of D-dimer will be addressed. Hemostasis (platelet and vascular function, coagulation, fibrinolysis, hemostasis) is briefly reviewed. D-dimer assays are reviewed. The D-dimer is very sensitive to intravascular thrombus and may be markedly elevated in disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolus. Because of its exquisite sensitivity, negative tests are useful in the exclusion venous thromboembolism. Elevations occur in normal pregnancy, rising two- to fourfold by delivery. D-dimer also rises with age, limiting its use in those >80 years old. There is a variable rise in D-dimer in active malignancy and indicates increased thrombosis risk in active disease. Elevated D-dimer following anticoagulation for a thrombotic event indicates increased risk of recurrent thrombosis. These and other issues are addressed.",2015,"['Olson', 'John D']"
"Effect of two doses of tranexamic acid on fibrinolysis evaluated by thromboelastography during cardiac surgery: a randomised, controlled study.","Tranexamic acid is used to decrease bleeding and transfusions during cardiac surgery. However, dosing based on pharmacokinetic data to optimally inhibit fibrinolysis is unknown. With increasing concerns regarding seizures associated with higher doses, lower dosing schemes may be important. To determine the effect of two dosing schemes compared with placebo on fibrinolysis and clinical outcomes. A double-blind, randomised, controlled, pilot trial. Single tertiary centre. Cardiac surgery patients requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients were randomised to receive a 30 mg  kg(-1) bolus and continuous infusion of 16  mg  kg (-1) h(-1) (Group HIGH), a 5 mg  kg(-1) bolus followed by 5 mg  kg(-1)  h(-1) (Group LOW) or Sodium chloride (Placebo). Fibrinolysis was evaluated by thromboelastography and D-dimers. Secondary endpoints were blood loss, transfusion requirement and side effects. Thirty-three patients were included. Significant fibrinolysis was defined by LY30 more than 7.5% based on thromboelastography and was not observed after cardiopulmonary bypass in any groups. After protamine administration, LY30 differences between groups were 0.7 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) -0.04 to 1.4] between Groups HIGH and Placebo, -0.08 (95% CI -0.82 to 0.66) between Groups HIGH and LOW, and 0.78 (95% CI 0.02 to 1.5) between Groups LOW and Placebo. A significant increase in D-dimers was observed in the Group Placebo compared with the two treatment groups. There were no differences in bleeding or transfusion requirement. In this dose-finding study, there were no differences in fibrinolysis or clinical outcomes among the two tranexamic acid schemes and placebo.

"Fibrinogen and factor XIII at the intersection of coagulation, fibrinolysis and inflammation.","Fibrinogen and factor XIII are two essential proteins that are involved directly in fibrin gel formation as the final step of a sequence of reactions triggered by a procoagulant stimulus. Haemostasis is the most obvious function of the resulting fibrin clot. Different variables affect the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin as well as the mode of fibrin polymerisation and fibrin crosslinking, hereby, critically influencing the architecture of the resulting fibrin network and consequently determining its mechanical strength and resistance against fibrinolysis. Due to fibrinogen's structure with a multitude of domains and binding motifs the fibrin gel allows for complex interactions with other coagulation factors, with profibrinolytic as well as antifibrinolyic proteins, with complement factors and with various cellular receptors. These interactions enable the fibrin network to control its own further state (i. e. expansion or degradation), to influence innate immunity, and to function as a scaffold for cell migration processes. During the whole process of fibrin gel formation biologically active peptides and protein fragments are released that additionally influence cellular processes via chemotaxis or by modulating cell-cell interactions. Thus, it is not surprising that fibrinogen and factor XIII in addition to their haemostatic function influence innate immunity as well as cell-mediated reactions like wound healing, response to tissue injury or inflammatory processes. The present review summarises current knowledge of fibrinogen's and factor XIII's function in coagulation and fibrinolysis giving special emphasis on their relation to inflammation control.",2014,"['Hoppe', 'Berthold']"
Effect of warfarin treatment on thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) activation and TAFI-mediated inhibition of fibrinolysis.,"Severe clotting deficiencies are associated with enhanced in vitro fibrinolysis due to insufficient thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) activation. Because oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) with warfarin causes a partial deficiency of vitamin K-dependent factors, its effect on clot lysability remains unclear. To evaluate plasma and blood fibrinolytic capacity in patients under stable OAT (n = 221) as compared with controls (n = 132). Fibrinolysis resistance of plasma (turbidimetry) and blood (thromboelastography) clots was calculated as the lysis time of tissue factor-induced clots exposed to 30 and 100 ng mL(-1) t-PA, respectively. Plasma PAI-1 was similar in the two groups, whereas TAFI was slightly lower in patients. OAT plasma clots lysed faster than controls (P = 0.001). The addition of the TAFIa inhibitor PTCI reduced lysis time by 14% in OAT and 34% in controls, and the difference between the groups disappeared. Similar data were obtained with blood clots. Thrombin and TAFIa generation in OAT plasma amounted to roughly 50% of controls, supporting a reduced thrombin-dependent TAFI activation. Clot resistance of OAT plasma was normalized by Ba-citrate plasma eluate or prothrombin but not by BaSO(4) serum eluate, rFVIIa or FX. Surprisingly, circulating levels of TAFIa and its inactive derivative TAFIai were higher in warfarin patients (P < 0.0001) and correlated with plasmin-antiplasmin (P = 0.0001) but not with prothrombin F(1) (+) (2) .",2013,"['Incampo, F', 'Carrieri, C', 'Galasso, R', 'Scaraggi, F A', 'Di Serio, F', 'Woodhams, B', 'Semeraro, N', 'Colucci, M']"
A novel serine protease secreted by medicinal maggots enhances plasminogen activator-induced fibrinolysis.,"Maggots of the blowfly Lucilia sericata are used for the treatment of chronic wounds. As haemostatic processes play an important role in wound healing, this study focused on the effects of maggot secretions on coagulation and fibrinolysis. The results showed that maggot secretions enhance plasminogen activator-induced formation of plasmin and fibrinolysis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. By contrast, coagulation was not affected by secretions. Biochemical studies indicated that a novel serine protease within secretions, designated Sericase, cleaved plasminogen to several fragments. Recombinant Sericase degraded plasminogen leading amongst others to the formation of the mini-plasminogen like fragment Val454-plasminogen. In addition, the presence of a non-proteolytic cofactor in secretions was discovered, which plays a role in the enhancement of plasminogen activator-induced fibrinolysis by Sericase. We conclude from our in vitro studies that the novel serine protease Sericase, with the aid of a non-proteolytic cofactor, enhances plasminogen activator-induced fibrinolysis.",2014,"['van der Plas, Mariena J A', 'Andersen, Anders S', 'Nazir, Sheresma', 'van Tilburg, Nico H', 'Oestergaard, Peter R', 'Krogfelt, Karen A', 'van Dissel, Jaap T', 'Hensbergen, Paul J', 'Bertina, Rogier M', 'Nibbering, Peter H']"
The role of coagulation/fibrinolysis during Streptococcus pyogenes infection.,"The hemostatic system comprises platelet aggregation, coagulation and fibrinolysis and is a host defense mechanism that protects the integrity of the vascular system after tissue injury. During bacterial infections, the coagulation system cooperates with the inflammatory system to eliminate the invading pathogens. However, pathogenic bacteria have frequently evolved mechanisms to exploit the hemostatic system components for their own benefit. Streptococcus pyogenes, also known as Group A Streptococcus, provides a remarkable example of the extraordinary capacity of pathogens to exploit the host hemostatic system to support microbial survival and dissemination. The coagulation cascade comprises the contact system (also known as the intrinsic pathway) and the tissue factor pathway (also known as the extrinsic pathway), both leading to fibrin formation. During the early phase of S. pyogenes infection, the activation of the contact system eventually leads to bacterial entrapment within a fibrin clot, where S. pyogenes is immobilized and killed. However, entrapped S. pyogenes can circumvent the antimicrobial effect of the clot by sequestering host plasminogen on the bacterial cell surface that, after conversion into its active proteolytic form, plasmin, degrades the fibrin network and facilitates the liberation of S. pyogenes from the clot. Furthermore, the surface-localized fibrinolytic activity also cleaves a variety of extracellular matrix proteins, thereby enabling S. pyogenes to migrate across barriers and disseminate within the host. This review summarizes the knowledge gained during the last two decades on the role of coagulation/fibrinolysis in host defense against S. pyogenes as well as the strategies developed by this pathogen to evade and exploit these host mechanisms for its own benefit.",2014,"['Loof, Torsten G', 'Deicke, Christin', 'Medina, Eva']"
Single wall carbon nanotube induced inflammation in cruor-fibrinolysis system.,"To study single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) and its role in inducing inflammatory cytokines in the cruor-fibrinolysis system of rat. Twenty one Wistar rats were divided into four groups: 1) control; 2) low-dose SWCNT (0.15 mg/kg BW); 3) medium-dose SWCNT (0.75 mg/kg BW); 4) high-dose SWCNT (1.5 mg/kg BW). Intratracheal instillation of SWCNT suspensions was administered to rats once per day for 21 days. In order to assess the exposure effect of SWCNT to the rats, activity of Inflammatory cytokine was measured and markers of cruor-fibrinolysis system were studied via ELSIA. Also, change in clotting time was recorded and histopathology was studied. IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations of rats exposed to SWCNT were significantly higher than those in controls (P<0.05). The activity of inflammatory cytokines and histopathological change indicated that oxidative damage occurred. Change in clotting time in rats exposed to SWCNT decreased compared with controls. Meanwhile, t-PA (tissue-tupe plassminogen activator) and AT-III (antithrombin-III) levels in rats exposed to particulates increased or decreased significantly compared with controls (P<0.05). A similar trend was observed for D-dimer (D2D) levels, indicating that SWCNT can impact the cruor-fibrinolysis system of rat.",2013,"['Tian, Lei', 'Lin, Zhi Qing', 'Lin, Ben Cheng', 'Liu, Huan Liang', 'Yan, Jun', 'Xi, Zhu Ge']"
A role for arginine-12 in thrombin-thrombomodulin-mediated activation of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor.,"Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is a proenzyme that links coagulation and fibrinolysis. TAFI can be activated by thrombin, the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex and plasmin through cleavage of the first 92 amino acids from the enzyme. In silico analysis of the TAFI sequence revealed a potential thrombin cleavage site at Arg12. The aim of this study was to determine whether TAFI can be cleaved at Arg12 and whether this cleavage plays a role in TAFI activation. A peptide based on the first 18 amino acids of TAFI was used to determine whether thrombin was able to cleave at Arg12. Mass spectrometry was performed to determine whether the Arg12-cleaved peptide was released from full-length TAFI. Furthermore, a TAFI mutant in which Arg12 was replaced by a glutamine (TAFI-R12Q) was constructed and characterized with respect to its activation kinetics. The peptide and mass spectrometry data showed that thrombin was able to cleave TAFI at Arg12, but with low efficiency in full-length TAFI. Characterization of TAFI-R12Q showed no difference in thrombin-mediated activation from wild-type TAFI. However, there was an approximately 60-fold impairment in activation of TAFI-R12Q by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex.",2014,"['Plug, T', 'Kramer, G', 'Meijers, J C M']"
Markers of thrombogenesis and fibrinolysis and their relation to inflammation and endothelial activation in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension.,"Chronic anticoagulation is a standard of care in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). However, hemostatic abnormalities in this disease remain poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to study markers of thrombogenesis and fibrinolysis in patients with IPAH. We studied 27 consecutive patients (67% female) with IPAH aged 50.0 years (IQR: 41.0-65.0) and 16 controls without pulmonary hypertension. Prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2) and thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes were measured to assess thrombogenesis; tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen and plasmin-anti-plasmin complex to characterize activation of fibrinolysis; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) to measure inhibition of fibrinolysis; and endothelin-1 (ET-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) to assess endothelial activation and systemic inflammation, respectively. In addition, in treatment-naive IPAH patients these markers were assessed after 3 months of PAH-specific therapies. TPA (10.1[6.8-15.8] vs 5.2[3.3-7.3] ng/ml, p<0.001), plasmin-anti-plasmin (91.5[60.3-94.2] vs 55.8[51.1-64.9] ng/ml, p<0.001), IL-6 (4.9[2.5-7.9] vs 2.1[1.3-3.8] pg/ml, p=0.001) and ET-1 (3.7 [3.3-4.5] vs 3.4[3.1-3.5], p= 0.03) were higher in patients with IPAH than in controls. In IPAH patients plasmin-anti-plasmin and tPA correlated positively with IL-6 (r=0.39, p=0.04 and r=0.63, p<0.001, respectively) and ET-1 (r=0.55, p=0.003 and r=0.59, p=0.001, respectively).

Endogenous Fibrinolysis: An Important Mediator of Thrombus Formation and Cardiovascular Risk.,"Most acute cardiovascular events are attributable to arterial thrombosis. Plaque rupture or erosion stimulates platelet activation, aggregation, and thrombosis, whilst simultaneously activating enzymatic processes that mediate endogenous fibrinolysis to physiologically maintain vessel patency. Interplay between these pathways determines clinical outcome. If proaggregatory factors predominate, the thrombus may propagate, leading to vessel occlusion. However, if balanced by a healthy fibrinolytic system, thrombosis may not occur or cause lasting occlusion. Despite abundant evidence for the fibrinolytic system regulating thrombosis, it has been overlooked compared with platelet reactivity, partly due to a lack of techniques to measure it. We evaluate evidence for endogenous fibrinolysis in arterial thrombosis and review techniques to assess it, including biomarkers and global assays, such as thromboelastography and the Global Thrombosis Test. Global assays, simultaneously assessing proaggregatory and fibrinolytic pathways, could play a role in risk stratification and in identifying impaired fibrinolysis as a potential target for pharmacological modulation.",2015,"['Okafor, Osita N', 'Gorog, Diana A']"
Clinical review: intrapericardial fibrinolysis in management of purulent pericarditis.,"Purulent pericarditis (PP) is a potentially life-threatening disease. Reported mortality rates are between 20 and 30%. Constrictive pericarditis occurs over the course of PP in at least 3.5% of cases. The frequency of persistent PP (chronic or recurrent purulent pericardial effusion occurring despite drainage and adequate antibiotherapy) is unknown because this entity was not previously classified as a complication of PP. No consensus exists on the optimal management of PP. Nevertheless, the cornerstone of PP management is complete eradication of the focus of infection. In retrospective studies, compared to simple drainage, systematic pericardiectomy provided a prevention of constrictive pericarditis with better clinical outcome. Because of potential morbidity associated with pericardiectomy, intrapericardial fibrinolysis has been proposed as a less invasive method for prevention of persistent PP and constrictive pericarditis. Experimental data demonstrate that fibrin formation, which occurs during the first week of the disease, is an essential step in the evolution to constrictive pericarditis and persistent PP. We reviewed the literature using the MEDLINE database. We evaluated the clinical efficacy, outcome, and complications of pericardial fibrinolysis. Seventy-four cases of fibrinolysis in PP were analysed. Pericarditis of tuberculous origin were excluded. Among the 40 included cases, only two treated by late fibrinolysis encountered failure requiring pericardiectomy. No patient encountered clinical or echocardiographic features of constriction during follow-up. Only one serious complication was described. Despite the lack of definitive evidence, potential benefits of fibrinolysis as a less invasive alternative to surgery in the management of PP seem promising. Early consideration should be given to fibrinolysis in order to prevent both constrictive and persistent PP. Nevertheless, in case of failure of fibrinolysis, pericardiectomy remains the primary option for complete eradication of infection.",2011,"['Augustin, Pascal', 'Desmard, Mathieu', 'Mordant, Pierre', 'Lasocki, Sigismond', 'Maury, Jean-Michel', 'Heming, Nicholas', 'Montravers, Philippe']"
Highly effective fibrinolysis by a sequential synergistic combination of mini-dose tPA plus low-dose mutant proUK.,"Results of thrombolysis by monotherapy with either tPA or proUK have not lived up to expectations. Since these natural activators are inherently complementary, this property can be utilized to a synergistic advantage; and yet, this has undergone little evaluation. ProUK is no longer available because at pharmacological concentrations it converts to UK in plasma. Therefore, a single site proUK mutant, M5, was developed to address this problem and was used in this study. Fibrinolysis was measured using preformed fluoresceinated 24 h old clots in a plasma milieu rather than by the standard automated method, because proUK/M5 is sensitive to inactivation by thrombin and activation by plasmin. The shortest 50% clot lysis time that could be achieved by tPA or M5 alone was determined: mean times were 55 and 48 minutes respectively. These bench marks were matched by 6% of the tPA monotherapy dose combined with 40% that of M5: mean lysis time 47 minutes with less associated fibrinogenolysis. Results showed that the tPA effect was limited to initiating fibrinolysis which was completed by M5 and then tcM5. Plasma C1-inhibitor inhibited fibrinogenolysis by M5, providing protection from side effects not available for proUK. In conclusion, by utilizing the complementary properties and sequential modes of action of each activator, more efficient fibrinolysis with less non-specific effects can be achieved than with traditional monotherapy. In vivo validation is needed, but in a previous clinical trial using a similar combination of tPA and proUK (5% and 50% monotherapy doses) very promising results have already been obtained.",2015,"['Pannell, Ralph', 'Li, Shelley', 'Gurewich, Victor']"
Coagulation and fibrinolysis abnormalities in familial amyloid polyneuropathy.,"Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is an autosomal dominant form of hereditary amyloidosis. Several studies reported coagulation factor X deficiency and excessive fibrinolysis in immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis. However, few have investigated coagulation and fibrinolysis in FAP. The objective of this study was to determine abnormalities in plasma biomarkers of coagulation and fibrinolysis in FAP. We prospectively recruited eight FAP patients with transthyretin mutations and ten age-matched control patients with other neuropathies in our university. We examined plasma biomarkers of coagulation and fibrinolysis including prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products, D-dimer, α2-antiplasmin, antithrombin, plasminogen, thrombin-antithrombin complex, plasmin-α2-antiplasmin complex, prothrombin fragment 1+2, and coagulation factor X.

"Tissue-type plasminogen activator-induced fibrinolysis is enhanced in patients with breast, lung, pancreas and colon cancer.","Although cancer-mediated changes in hemostatic proteins unquestionably promote hypercoagulation, the effects of neoplasia on fibrinolysis in the circulation are less well defined. The goals of the present investigation were to determine if plasma obtained from patients with breast, lung, pancreas and colon cancer was less or more susceptible to lysis by tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) compared to plasma obtained from normal individuals. Archived plasma obtained from patients with breast (n = 18), colon/pancreas (n = 27) or lung (n = 19) was compared to normal individual plasma (n = 30) using a thrombelastographic assay that assessed fibrinolytic vulnerability to exogenously added tPA. Plasma samples were activated with tissue factor/celite, had tPA added, and had data collected until clot lysis occurred. Additional, similar samples had potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor added to assess the role played by thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor in cancer-modulated fibrinolysis. Rather than inflicting a hypofibrinolytic state, the three groups of cancers demonstrated increased vulnerability to tPA (e.g. decreased time to lysis, increased speed of lysis, decreased clot lysis time). However, hypercoagulation manifested as increased speed of clot formation and strength compensated for enhanced fibrinolytic vulnerability, resulting in a clot residence time that was not different from normal individual thrombi. In sum, enhanced hypercoagulability associated with cancer was in part diminished by enhanced fibrinolytic vulnerability to tPA.",2014,"['Nielsen, Vance G', 'Matika, Ryan W', 'Ley, Michele L B', 'Waer, Amy L', 'Gharagozloo, Farid', 'Kim, Samuel', 'Nfonsam, Valentine N', 'Ong, Evan S', 'Jie, Tun', 'Warneke, James A', 'Steinbrenner, Evangelina B']"

Patients with longer diabetes duration (>5 years, median; n=68) had higher peak thrombin generation (+16.3%, p<0.001), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen (+14.8%, p=0.001), t-PA antigen (+13.9%, p=0.002) compared with those with duration ≤5 years (n=88). No such differences were observed between patients with inadequate glycaemic control, defined as glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) >6.5% (48 mmol/mol) (n=77), versus those with HbA1C≤6.5% (n=79). Fibrinogen, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor antigen, plasminogen and soluble thrombomodulin were unaffected by disease duration or glycaemia control. Lower clot permeability, longer clot lysis, and higher maximum D-dimer levels released from clots (all p<0.05 after adjustment for fibrinogen, age, body mass index, insulin, acetylsalicylic acid treatment, and HbA1c or diabetes duration) were also observed in patients with diabetes duration >5 years and those with HbA1C>6.5%. We conclude that prolonged duration of type 2 diabetes is associated with increased thrombin formation, hypofibrinolysis, and prothrombotic fibrin clot phenotype. The impact of disease duration on coagulation is different and stronger than that observed during inadequate glycaemia control.",2014,"['Konieczynska, Malgorzata', 'Fil, Korneliusz', 'Bazanek, Marta', 'Undas, Anetta']"
Plasma Fibrinolysis Parameters in Smokers and Non-smokers of the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health (LURIC) Study.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Parameters of coagulation and fibrinolysis are risk factors of CVD and might be affected by cigarette smoking. Aim of our study was to analyze the effect of cigarette smoking on parameters of fibrinolysis in active smokers (AS) and life-time non-smokers (NS) of the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health (LURIC) Study as well as the use of these parameters for risk prediction. We determined plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue plasminogen activator antigen (t-PA), protein C activity, and D-dimers in 3,316 LURIC patients. Smoking status was assessed by a questionnaire and measurement of plasma cotinine concentration. Cox regression was used to assess the effect of parameters on mortality. We found that of the 3,316 LURIC patients 777 were AS and 1,178 NS. Within the observation period of 10 years (median) 221 AS and 302 NS died. In male AS vs. NS, PAI-1 (19.0 (10.0-35.0) vs. 15.0 (9.0-29.0) U/ml; p=0.026) and t-PA antigen (12.7 (9.6-16.3) vs. 11.6 (8.9-14.6) μg/l; p=0.020) were slightly increased, while t-PA activity was slightly decreased (0.63 (0.30-1.05) vs. 0.68 (0.42-1.10) U/l; p=0.005). In female AS vs. NS, t-PA antigen (10.5 (8.3-13.9) vs. 11.5 (8.8-15.0) μg/l; p=0.025) and protein C (108.0±24.1% vs. 118.0±25.7%; p=0.004) were decreased. All parameters except for protein C were predictive for mortality in AS. Fully adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) were 1.14 (1.04-1.25), 1.19 (1.06-1.34), and 1.29 (1.11-1.49) per 1SD increase for D-dimer, t-PA, and PAI-1, respectively. Including fibrinolysis parameters in risk prediction models for mortality improved the area-under-the-curve (AUC) significantly compared with the conventional risk factors. In conclusion, we found alterations in the fibrinolytic system in smokers, which were more pronounced in male AS. PAI-1, t-PA and D-dimers were significant predictors of mortality in AS in LURIC and should be included into the assessment of cardiovascular risk particularly in patients at risk.",2015,"['Delgado, Graciela E', 'Siekmeier, Rüdiger', 'Krämer, Bernhard K', 'März, Winfried', 'Kleber, Marcus E']"
Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor influences disease severity in humans and mice with pneumococcal meningitis.,"Mortality and morbidity in patients with bacterial meningitis result from the proinflammatory response and dysregulation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is activated by free thrombin or thrombin in complex with thrombomodulin, and plays an antifibrinolytic role during fibrin clot degradation, but also has an anti-inflammatory role by inactivating proinflammatory mediators, such as complement activation products. To assess the role of TAFI in pneumococcal meningitis. We performed a prospective nationwide genetic association study in patients with bacterial meningitis, determined TAFI and complement levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and assessed the function of TAFI in a pneumococcal meningitis mouse model by using Cpb2 (TAFI) knockout mice. Polymorphisms (reference sequences: rs1926447 and rs3742264) in the CPB2 gene, coding for TAFI, were related to the development of systemic complications in patients with pneumococcal meningitis. Higher protein levels of TAFI in CSF were significantly associated with CSF complement levels (C3a, iC3b, and C5b-9) and with more systemic complications in patients with bacterial meningitis. The risk allele of rs1926447 (TT) was associated with higher levels of TAFI in CSF. In the murine model, consistent with the human data, Cpb2-deficient mice had decreased disease severity, as reflected by lower mortality, and attenuated cytokine levels and bacterial outgrowth in the systemic compartment during disease, without differences in the brain compartment, as compared with wild-type mice.",2015,"['Mook-Kanamori, B B', 'Valls Serón, M', 'Geldhoff, M', 'Havik, S R', 'van der Ende, A', 'Baas, F', 'van der Poll, T', 'Meijers, J C M', 'P Morgan, B', 'Brouwer, M C', 'van de Beek, D']"
"Denser plasma clot formation and impaired fibrinolysis in paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation while on sinus rhythm: association with thrombin generation, endothelial injury and platelet activation.","Formation of compact and poorly lysable fibrin clots have been demonstrated in patients following ischemic stroke. Recently, it has been shown that denser fibrin networks and impaired fibrinolysis occurs in subjects with permanent atrial fibrillation (AF). Fibrin clot phenotype in other types of AF remains to be established. We evaluated fibrin clot properties in paroxysmal (PAF) and persistent AF (PsAF). We studied 88 non-anticoagulated patients with AF on sinus rhythm and free of stroke (41 with PAF, 47 with PsAF) versus 50 controls. Ex-vivo plasma fibrin clot permeability (Ks) and clot lysis time (CLT) were evaluated along with von Willebrand factor (vWF), peak thrombin generation (TG), platelet factor 4 (PF4) and fibrinolytic proteins. Compared with control subjects, clots obtained from plasma of patients with PAF and PsAF had similarly lower Ks (-7.7%, P=0.01; -8.6%, P=0.005, respectively) and prolonged CLT (+10.8%, P=0.006; +7.8% P=0.04, respectively). No associations of Ks and CLT with CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED score were observed. Patients with AF had higher TG, vWF, PF4 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen compared with controls. Multiple linear regression adjusted for age, gender, body mass index and fibrinogen showed that TG (β=-0.41), vWF (β=-0.29) and PF4 (β=-0.28) are the independent predictors of Ks (R(2)=0.78), while CLT was independently predicted by TG (β=0.37), PAI-1 antigen (β=0.29) and vWF (β=0.26) in the AF group (R(2)=0.39).",2015,"['Drabik, Leszek', 'Wołkow, Paweł', 'Undas, Anetta']"
Blood coagulation and fibrinolysis in aortic valve stenosis: links with inflammation and calcification.,"Aortic valve stenosis (AS) increasingly afflicts our aging population. However, the pathobiology of the disease is still poorly understood and there is no effective pharmacotherapy for treating those at risk for clinical progression. The progression of AS involves complex inflammatory and fibroproliferative processes that resemble to some extent atherosclerosis. Accumulating evidence indicates that several coagulation proteins and its inhibitors, including tissue factor, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, prothrombin, factor XIII, von Willebrand factor, display increased expression within aortic stenotic valves, predominantly on macrophages and myofibroblasts around calcified areas. Systemic impaired fibrinolysis, along with increased plasma and valvular expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, has also been observed in patients with AS in association with the severity of the disease. There is an extensive cross-talk between inflammation and coagulation in stenotic valve tissue which contributes to the calcification and mineralisation of the aortic valve leaflets. This review summarises the available data on blood coagulation and fibrinolysis in AS with the emphasis on their interactions with inflammation and calcification.",2015,"['Natorska, J', 'Undas, A']"
Effect of mild hypothermia on the coagulation-fibrinolysis system and physiological anticoagulants after cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a porcine model.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of mild hypothermia on the coagulation-fibrinolysis system and physiological anticoagulants after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A total of 20 male Wuzhishan miniature pigs underwent 8 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation and CPR. Of these, 16 were successfully resuscitated and were randomized into the mild hypothermia group (MH, n = 8) or the control normothermia group (CN, n = 8). Mild hypothermia (33°C) was induced intravascularly, and this temperature was maintained for 12 h before pigs were actively rewarmed. The CN group received normothermic post-cardiac arrest (CA) care for 72 h. Four animals were in the sham operation group (SO). Blood samples were taken at baseline, and 0.5, 6, 12, 24, and 72 h after ROSC. Whole-body mild hypothermia impaired blood coagulation during cooling, but attenuated blood coagulation impairment at 72 h after ROSC. Mild hypothermia also increased serum levels of physiological anticoagulants, such as PRO C and AT-III during cooling and after rewarming, decreased EPCR and TFPI levels during cooling but not after rewarming, and inhibited fibrinolysis and platelet activation during cooling and after rewarming. Finally, mild hypothermia did not affect coagulation-fibrinolysis, physiological anticoagulants, or platelet activation during rewarming. Thus, our findings indicate that mild hypothermia exerted an anticoagulant effect during cooling, which may have inhibitory effects on microthrombus formation. Furthermore, mild hypothermia inhibited fibrinolysis and platelet activation during cooling and attenuated blood coagulation impairment after rewarming. Slow rewarming had no obvious adverse effects on blood coagulation.",2013,"['Gong, Ping', 'Zhang, Ming-Yue', 'Zhao, Hong', 'Tang, Zi-Ren', 'Hua, Rong', 'Mei, Xue', 'Cui, Juan', 'Li, Chun-Sheng']"
Proteolytic modulation of factor Xa-antithrombin complex enhances fibrinolysis in plasma.,"Our previous work showed that purified coagulation factor Xa (FXa) acquires fibrinolysis cofactor activity after plasmin-mediated cleavage. The predominant functional species is a non-covalent heterodimer of 33 and 13kDa, termed Xa33/13, which has predicted newly exposed C-terminal lysines that are important for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-mediated plasminogen activation to plasmin. To provide evidence that this mechanism occurs in a physiological context, here we demonstrated the appearance of Xa33 in clotting plasma by western blot analysis. Since the normal fate of FXa is stable association with antithrombin (AT), an AT western blot was conducted, which revealed a band of ~13kDa higher apparent molecular weight than AT that appeared concurrent to Xa33. Sequencing of purified proteins confirmed the generation of Xa13 covalently bound to AT and Xa33 (Xa33/13-AT) by cleavages at Lys-Met339 and Lys-Asp389. Ligand blots demonstrated (125)I-plasminogen binding to the Xa33 subunit of plasmin-generated Xa33/13-AT. Purified XaAT added to plasma that was induced to clot enhanced the rate of tPA-mediated fibrinolysis by ~16-fold. Similarly, purified plasminogen activation by tPA was enhanced by ~16-fold by XaAT. Plasmin cleaves XaAT and exposes plasminogen binding sites at least 10-fold faster than FXa. Here we demonstrate a novel function for AT, which accelerates the modulation of FXa into the fibrinolytic form, Xa33/13. The consequent exposure of C-terminal lysine binding sites essential for plasminogen activation enhances fibrinolysis. These results are consistent with a model where auxiliary cofactors link coagulation to fibrinolysis by priming the accelerating role of fibrin.",2013,"['Talbot, Kimberley', 'Meixner, Scott C', 'Pryzdial, Edward L G']"
Novel or expanding current targets in fibrinolysis.,"Globally the leading cause of long-term disability and mortality stems from cardiovascular diseases, which creates an enormous economic burden. Currently available treatments for intravascular thrombosis consist of a large repertoire of antithrombotic agents targeting coagulation and platelet function. However, the only agents available to enhance fibrinolysis are recombinant or modified forms of plasminogen activators. Their clinical use is limited by low efficacy, life-threatening side-effects (primarily caused by the high systemic dose required) and the inapplicability for prophylactic use. This review provides an update on the latest advances in targeting the antifibrinolytic proteins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, and will highlight novel therapeutic avenues to enhance fibrinolysis.",2014,"['Wyseure, Tine', 'Declerck, Paul J']"
Effects of Shen-Fu injection on coagulation-fibrinolysis disorders in a porcine model of cardiac arrest.,"The objective of the study is to investigate the effects of Shen-Fu injection (SFI) on coagulation-fibrinolysis disorders in a porcine model of cardiac arrest. Thirty Wuzhishan pigs were randomly assigned into the sham operation group (SO group, n = 6), epinephrine group (EP group, n = 12), and SFI group (n = 12). After 8 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation (VF), pigs in the EP group or SFI group were administered with either EP (0.02 mg/kg) or SFI (1.0 mL/kg), respectively. Plasma levels of tissue factor, thrombin-antithrombin complex, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, antithrombin III, protein C, tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, soluble thrombomodulin, and soluble endothelial protein C receptor were measured at baseline, 1, 6, 12, and 24 hours after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). In addition, arterial lactate levels were measured at baseline, 1, 6, 12, and 24 hours after ROSC, and lactate clearance was calculated at 1, 6, 12, and 24 hours after ROSC. Compared with the EP group, tissue factor, thrombin-antithrombin complex, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, tissue plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 levels were significantly lower, whereas antithrombin III and protein C levels were significantly higher in the SFI group (all P < .05). In addition, soluble thrombomodulin and soluble endothelial protein C receptor levels in the SFI group were significantly lower in comparison to the EP group (all P < .01). Furthermore, arterial lactate levels were significantly lower, and lactate clearance was higher in the SFI group (all P < .01).",2016,"['Yin, Qin', 'Liu, Bo', 'Wu, Caijun', 'Yang, Jun', 'Hang, Chenchen', 'Li, Chunsheng']"
Acute CO poisoning is associated with impaired fibrinolysis and increased thrombin generation.,"Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a leading cause of unintentional poisoning deaths in many countries. In ex vivo studies, CO released from carbon monoxide-releasing molecules has been shown to attenuate fibrinolysis via increased alpha-2-antiplasmin activity. Hypofibrinolysis is associated with coronary ischaemia, which is also commonly observed in CO poisoning. We examined fibrin clot properties in acutely poisoned CO patients. Ex vivo plasma fibrin clot permeability, turbidimetry and efficiency of fibrinolysis were investigated in 48 patients and controls matched for age and sex. CO-poisoned patients had 11.6% longer clot lysis time than the controls (p < 0.0001). No intergroup differences in clot permeability or turbidimetric variables were observed. Plasma tissue-type plasminogen antigen (tPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen and activity and F1.2 prothrombin fragments were higher in the patients than in the controls (all p < 0.0001). Plasma tPA activity was lower in the CO-poisoned group. Multiple linear regression showed that a thrombin generation marker, F1.2, is the strongest predictor of clot lysis time, followed by PAI-1 activity and carboxyhaemoglobin levels. In conclusion, this report is the first to demonstrate that acute CO poisoning in human beings is linked to increased thrombin generation and impaired fibrinolysis, which might contribute to ischaemic complications.",2013,"['Gawlikowski, Tomasz', 'Gomolka, Ewa', 'Piekoszewski, Wojciech', 'Jawień, Wojciech', 'Undas, Anetta']"
"The hypercoagulable state in Cushing's disease is associated with increased levels of procoagulant factors and impaired fibrinolysis, but is not reversible after short-term biochemical remission induced by medical therapy.","Cushing's disease (CD) is accompanied by an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. Surgery is the primary treatment of CD. The aim of the study was to compare hemostatic parameters between patients with CD and controls and to evaluate the effect of medical treatment of CD on hemostasis. During 80 d, stepwise medical treatment was applied with the somatostatin analog pasireotide, the dopamine agonist cabergoline, and ketoconazole, which suppresses adrenocortical steroidogenesis, at four university medical centers in The Netherlands. Seventeen patients with de novo, residual, or recurrent CD were included. We measured urinary free cortisol and parameters of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Patients with CD had significantly higher body mass index (P < 0.001), shortened activated partial thromboplastin time (P < 0.01), and higher levels of fibrinogen, Factor VIII, and protein S activity (P < 0.05) compared to healthy control subjects. In addition, fibrinolytic capacity was impaired in patients with CD as reflected by prolonged clot lysis time (P < 0.001) and higher levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, and α2-antiplasmin (P < 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences in von Willebrand factor:antigen, antithrombin, and protein C activity. After 80 d, 15 of 17 patients had normalized urinary free cortisol excretion.

"Activation of endothelium, coagulation and fibrinolysis is enhanced and associates with renal anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis.","While the incidence of thromboembolism in anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies-associated vasculitis (AAV) is high, the coagulation and fibrinolysis profile in AAV patients remains poorly characterized. We aimed at studying this profile in association with vasculitis activity and renal function. This prospective study included 21 AAV patients with renal disease and 40 controls with other chronic kidney disease. Platelet count, antithrombin, FVIII : C, von Willebrand factor (VWF) activities (VWF : RCo) and antigen (VWF : Ag), fibrinogen, prothrombin fragments (F1 + 2), fibrin degradation product d-dimer and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies were measured during the active and remission states of the AAV and at the baseline in controls. Occurrence of thromboembolic events was recorded. F1 + 2 was 2.6-fold and D-dimer was 5-fold higher during the active AAV than its remission (median 563 versus 212 pM and 3.0 versus 0.6 mg/L, P = 0.001 for both). FVIII : C (median 228%), VWF : RCo (198%) and VWF : Ag (222%) were the highest among the patients with active AAV and remained elevated also under remission. In active AAV, both F1 + 2 and d-dimer clearly associated with impaired renal function (r = -0.67, P = 0.001 and r = -0.66, P = 0.001).

Alterations of coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency.,"Patients with functional deficiency of C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) suffer from recurrent acute attacks (AA) of localized oedema associated with activation of the contact system, complement and fibrinolysis. To unravel further the role of coagulation and fibrinolysis in the pathophysiology of C1-INH deficiency, we performed simultaneous thrombin and plasmin generation measurements in plasma from patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1-INH deficiency during AA (n = 23), in remission (R) (n = 20) and in controls (n = 20). During AA thrombin generation after in-vitro activation of plasma was higher than in controls, as demonstrated by shorter thrombin peak-time (P < 0·05), higher thrombin peak-height (P < 0·001) and increased area under the curve (AUC) (P < 0·05). Additionally, elevated levels of prothrombin fragment 1+2 (P < 0·0001) were observed in non-activated plasma from the same patients. In contrast, in activated plasma from patients during AA plasmin generation estimated as plasmin peak-height (P < 0·05) and plasmin potential (P < 0·05) was reduced, but non-activated plasma of the same patients showed elevated plasmin-anti-plasmin (PAP) complexes (P < 0·001). This apparent discrepancy can be reconciled by elevated soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) (P < 0·01) and thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) in patients during AA providing possible evidence for a regulatory effect on fibrinolysis. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) was reduced in patients during AA indicating, together with the observed reduction of plasmin generation, the consumption of fibrinolytic factors. In conclusion, our results support the involvement of coagulation and fibrinolysis in the pathophysiology of HAE and show the possible application of simultaneous measurement of thrombin and plasmin generation to evaluate different clinical conditions in HAE patients.",2012,"['van Geffen, M', 'Cugno, M', 'Lap, P', 'Loof, A', 'Cicardi, M', 'van Heerde, W']"
Preservation of peritoneal fibrinolysis owing to decreased transcription of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in peritoneal mesothelial cells suppresses postoperative adhesion formation in laparoscopic surgery.,"Postoperative adhesion formation is regulated by peritoneal fibrinolysis, which is determined by tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). This study compared peritoneal fibrinolysis and adhesion formation after laparoscopic surgery (LAP) and open surgery (OP). We divided 154 male rats into 3 groups after cecal cauterization: Control, no treatment; LAP, CO2 pneumoperitoneum at 5 mmHg for 60 minutes; and OP, laparotomy for 60 minutes. Adhesions were quantified at day 7. The activity and mRNA level of tPA and PAI-1 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in plasma and peritoneal lavage and by real-time polymerase chain reaction in peritoneal mesothelial cells from omentum. We also examined peritoneal fibrinolysis in human gastric cancer patients treated with LAP (n = 14) or OP (n = 10). In the animal study, adhesion scores, PAI-1 activity in peritoneal lavage fluid, and PAI-1 mRNA levels in peritoneal mesothelium were significantly greater in the OP group than the control and LAP groups.

Role of routine early angiography post-fibrinolysis for ST elevation myocardial infarction--a meta-regression analysis using angiography rate in the non-routine arm.,"The current European and American Guidelines differ with regard to the recommended level for the use of routine early angiography after fibrinolysis for STEMI. Previous meta-analyses on randomized controlled trials have supported the routine early approach, but its advantage may be because of an excessively low angiography rate among patients in the non-routine strategy arm of the trials. We update the meta-analysis and apply meta-regression to evaluate whether the difference in outcome between the 2 randomized arms could be explained by the angiography rates in the non-routine strategy arm. Because reinfarction and recurrent ischemia are often the reported indication for angiography, we only use mortality endpoint in our meta-regression analysis. Among the eight trials included with 3195 patients, the angiography rate in the non-routine strategy arms ranges from 15% to 100%. The overall odds ratio for 30-day mortality comparing the routine early angiography arm vs the non-routine arm is 0.86 (95% confidence interval 0.60-1.24). On the plot listing the eight trials according to angiography rates, there is no visual trend in the odds ratio estimates for mortality when comparing the 2 treatment strategies as angiography rate decreases. In meta-regression analysis, angiography rate does not predict 30-day mortality (p=0.461).",2013,"['Wong, Cheuk-Kit', 'Leon de la Barra, Sophia', 'Herbison, Peter']"
Can exercise capacity assessed by the 6 minute walk test predict the development of major adverse cardiac events in patients with STEMI after fibrinolysis?,"To assess the added value of the 6 minute walk test distance (6MWTD) in the risk-stratification methods for patients with ST -segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with fibrinolysis. This is a prospective cohort study of one hundred consecutive patients with STEMI, who had received fibrinolysis, at Assuit University Hospital. All patients underwent 6MWT pre- discharge and were followed up for 3 months to monitor the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the level of 6MWTD (level I>450 m, level II = 300-450 m and level III<300 m). Among the study population, the median 6MWT distance was 370 meters (interquartile range 162-462). The mean age was 60.9±10.7 years, 71.9% of them were males, 2/3 had anterior MI. only 10.5% had successful thrombolysis. Compared to patients in level I (>450 m), patients in level III (<300 m) were more likely to have clinical risk factors as hypertension, diabetes and impaired renal function. The patient's mean TIMI score was 3.4±2.2, the mean GRACE score was 150.5±27.7. There was a significant negative correlation between the 6 MWTD and GRACE risk score (r = -0.80, p<0.001). At 3 months of follow-up, 51% had MACE including 16% were dead. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified that the GRACE risk score and 6MWT distance levels were the best predictors of the MACE at 3 month of follow up. The incidence of MACE was 4 times higher in patients with high GRACE risk score who couldn't walk more than 300 meters (OR = 4.66, 95% CI = 1.1-14.5, p = 0.006).",2014,"['Hassan, Ayman K M', 'Dimitry, Salwa R', 'Agban, George W']"
Disseminated intravascular coagulation at an early phase of trauma is associated with consumption coagulopathy and excessive fibrinolysis both by plasmin and neutrophil elastase.,"The aims of the present study were to confirm the consumption coagulopathy of disseminated intravascular coagulation with the fibrinolytic phenotype at an early phase of trauma and to test the hypothesis that thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, neutrophil elastase, and plasmin contribute to the increased fibrinolysis of this type of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Furthermore, we hypothesized that disseminated intravascular coagulation at an early phase of trauma progresses dependently to disseminated intravascular coagulation with a thorombotic phenotype from 3 to 5 days after injury. Fifty-seven trauma patients, including 30 patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation and 27 patients without disseminated intravascular coagulation, were studied prospectively. Levels of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, tissue-type plasminogen activator plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 complex, plasmin alpha2 plasmin inhibitor complex, D-dimer, neutrophil elastase, and fibrin degradation product by neutrophil elastase were measured on days 1, 3, and 5 after trauma. The prothrombin time, fibrinogen, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation product, antithrombin, and lactate also were measured. Independent of the lactate levels, disseminated intravascular coagulation patients showed a prolonged prothrombin time, lesser fibrinogen and antithrombin levels, and increased levels of fibrin/fibrinogen degradation product on day 1. Disseminated intravascular coagulation diagnosed on day 1 continued to late-phase disseminated intravascular coagulation on days 3 and 5 after trauma. Increased levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 complex, plasmin alpha2 plasmin inhibitor complex, D-dimer, neutrophil elastase, and fibrin degradation product by neutrophil elastase but not thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor were observed in the disseminated intravascular coagulation patients. No correlation was observed between plasmin alpha2 plasmin inhibitor complex and fibrin degradation product by neutrophil elastase in disseminated intravascular coagulation patients. Multiple regression analysis showed the disseminated intravascular coagulation score and the tissue-type plasminogen activator plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 complex levels on day 1 to correlate with the total volume of transfused blood.

Prognostic value of plasma fibrinolysis activation markers in cardiovascular disease.,"The pivotal role of hypoactive endogenous fibrinolysis in the occurrence of thrombotic cardiovascular events is now well-recognized. To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic role of impaired fibrinolysis, plasma fibrinolysis markers have been investigated in large prospective studies in both healthy individuals and patients with established coronary disease. Antigen and activity levels of components of the fibrinolytic system were measured by immunoassays, which replaced earlier global fibrinolysis tests. This review covers 45 studies in nearly 50,000 subjects, examining the association between plasma markers of fibrinolysis and coronary artery disease, to establish the usefulness of these markers in predicting future cardiovascular events. The predictive value of plasma levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator, platelet activator inhibitor-1, plasmin-antiplasmin complex, D-dimer, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, and lipoprotein(a) for major adverse cardiac events is highly variable and conflicting, especially after adjusting for conventional risk factors, judging from the published data in the last decade. The value of fibrinolysis activity markers is very limited in aiding diagnosis and risk stratification in the individual patient, on the basis of the weak prognostic values obtained in some studies and the lack of power in others. The physiological limitations of such markers in reflecting endogenous fibrinolysis is discussed. The emerging novel global assays of fibrinolysis will require large-scale clinical trials before their prognostic power or superiority to multiple biomarker measurements can be evaluated.",2010,"['Gorog', 'Diana A']"
Nebulized fibrinolytic agents improve pulmonary fibrinolysis but not inflammation in rat models of direct and indirect acute lung injury.,"Critically ill patients frequently develop acute lung injury (ALI). Disturbed alveolar fibrin turnover, a characteristic feature of ALI, is the result of both activation of coagulation and inhibition of fibrinolysis. Nebulized fibrinolytic agents could exert lung-protective effects, via promotion of fibrinolysis as well as anti-inflammation. Rats were challenged intratracheally with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, resulting in pneumonia as a model for direct ALI, or received an intravenous bolus infusion of lipopolysaccharide, as a model for indirect ALI. Rats were randomized to nebulization of normal saline (placebo), recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), or monoclonal antibodies against plasminogen activator inhibitor-type 1 (anti-PAI-1). Nebulized rtPA or anti-PA1-1 enhanced the bronchoalveolar fibrinolytic system, as reflected by a significant reduction of PAI-1 activity levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and a consequent increase in plasminogen activator activity (PAA) levels to supranormal values. Both treatments also significantly affected systemic fibrinolysis as reflected by a significant increase in PAA levels in plasma to supranormal levels. Neither nebulized rtPA nor anti-PA1-1 affected pulmonary inflammation. Neither treatment affected bacterial clearance of P. aeruginosa from the lungs in case of pneumonia.",2013,"['Hofstra, Jorrit J', 'Cornet, Alexander D', 'Declerck, Paul J', 'Dixon, Barry', 'Aslami, Hamid', 'Vlaar, Alexander P J', 'Roelofs, Joris J', 'van der Poll, Tom', 'Levi, Marcel', 'Schultz, Marcus J']"
Effect of endovascular and open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair on thrombin generation and fibrinolysis.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is associated with a prothrombotic diathesis that may increase the risk of cardiovascular events. This diathesis is exacerbated in the short term by open aneurysm repair (OAR) and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). However, the effect of EVAR and OAR on coagulation and fibrinolysis in the medium and long term is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the medium-term effects of EVAR and OAR on thrombin generation, neutralization, and fibrinolysis. Prothrombin fragment (PF)1+2, thrombin antithrombin (TAT) complex, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) activity, and tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen were measured in eight age-matched controls (AMCs), 29 patients with AAA immediately before (preoperatively) and 12 months after EVAR (post-EVAR), and in 11 patients at a mean of 16 months after OAR (post-OAR). Preoperatively, PF1+2 levels were significantly higher in patients with AAAs than in AMC. PF1+2 levels post-EVAR and post-OAR were significantly lower than preoperative values and similar to AMC. There was no significant difference in TAT, PAI, or t-PA between AMC, AAA preoperatively, and post-EVAR. Post-OAR, PAI activity was significantly higher than in preoperative patients.",2013,"['Abdelhamid, Mohamed F', 'Davies, Robert S M', 'Vohra, Rajiv K', 'Adam, Donald J', 'Bradbury, Andrew W']"
"Abnormalities in blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and platelet activation in adult patients after the Fontan procedure.","Thrombosis occurs in up to 30% of patients with various forms of congenital single ventricle after the Fontan procedure. We investigated hemostatic abnormalities in adult Fontan patients. Forty-eight Fontan patients between ages 18 and 40 years, including 10 (21%) patients with previous thromboembolism 5 to 15 years after surgery, and 35 control subjects matched for age and sex were studied. Coagulation factors and inhibitors, together with markers of fibrinolysis, platelets, and endothelial activation, were determined in peripheral venous blood plasma. Compared with control subjects, Fontan patients showed lower, although mostly within normal ranges, values of all coagulation factors, as well as reduced free protein S, in association with higher antithrombin and free tissue factor pathway inhibitor levels. Thrombin generation, reflected by prothrombin fragment 1.2, and platelet activation markers were increased in Fontan patients. The plasma clot lysis time was prolonged in Fontan patients, which was associated with an increased activity of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor. Fontan patients with previous thromboembolism had lower oxygen saturation, coagulation factors V and VIII, and free protein S, and increased von Willebrand factor, soluble CD40 ligand, and P-selectin. Other laboratory or clinical parameters were not associated with prior thrombotic episodes.",2014,"['Tomkiewicz-Pajak, Lidia', 'Hoffman, Piotr', 'Trojnarska, Olga', 'Lipczyńska, Magdalena', 'Podolec, Piotr', 'Undas, Anetta']"
EFFECT OF ε-AMINOCAPROIC ACID ON FIBRINOLYSIS IN PLASMA OF ASIAN ELEPHANTS (ELEPHAS MAXIMUS).,"ε-Aminocaproic acid (EACA) is a lysine analogue antifibrinolytic drug used to treat bleeding disorders in humans and domestic animals. Use in zoological medicine is rare and dose recommendations are anecdotal, but EACA may be a valuable therapeutic option for bleeding disorders in exotic species, including Asian elephants ( Elephas maximus ). This study used an in vitro model of hyperfibrinolysis and a thromboelastograph-based assay to estimate the therapeutic plasma concentration of EACA in Asian elephants (61.5 μg/ml, 95% CI = 34.6-88.5 μg/ml). Substantial but incomplete inhibition of lysis was seen at relatively low concentrations of EACA (40 μg/ml). Asian elephants appear sensitive to EACA-mediated inhibition of hyperfibrinolysis. Doses published for domestic animals, targeting higher plasma concentrations, may be inappropriate in this species.",2016,"['Kaye, Sarrah', 'Abou-Madi, Noha', 'Fletcher, Daniel J']"
Fibrinolysis alterations in infertile women during controlled ovarian stimulation: influence of BMI and genetic components.,"Ovarian stimulation protocols have been described to induce prothrombotic phenotype through alterations of both coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways. We investigated fibrinolytic changes during ovarian stimulation through a global test (CLT) and PAI-1 and TAFI concentrations at different times of ovarian stimulation procedure, and the influence of polymorphisms in genes encoding for fibrinogen chains (FGA, FGB, FGG), t-PA (PLAT), TAFI (CBP2), FXIII (FXIIA1, FXIIIB), plasminogen (PLG) and PAI-1 (PAI1) on their intermediate phenotype. We evaluated fibrinolytic and genetic parameters in 110 infertile women undergoing ovarian stimulation procedure (in vitro fertilization, IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection, ICSI). All women were observed during the mid-luteal phase of cycle (T(0)) and on day 5 (T(1)), 7 (T(2)) and 9 (T(3)) of the ovarian stimulation. Significant changes in fibrinolytic parameters from T(0) to T(3) of ovarian stimulation were found (CLT p=0.003; TAFI p=0.009 and PAI-1 p=0.003). CLT values, TAFI and PAI-1 concentrations significantly increased from baseline to T(1) (p<0.0001, p=0.01, p=0.005, respectively)(,) and decreased at T(2,) but remained higher than those at T(0). Moreover, at baseline overweight women showed longer CLT, higher TAFI and PAI-1 concentrations than normal weight women, as well as at T(1) two-fold longer CLT and higher PAI-1 concentrations were observed (p=0.001 and p=0.05, respectively). Significant differences of TAFI and PAI-1 concentrations during ovarian stimulation according to TAFI and PAI1 polymorphisms were observed.",2012,"['Sticchi, Elena', 'Romagnuolo, Ilaria', 'Cellai, Anna Paola', 'Lami, Donatella', 'Fedi, Sandra', 'Prisco, Domenico', 'Noci, Ivo', 'Abbate, Rosanna', 'Fatini, Cinzia']"
Modelling fibrinolysis: 1D continuum models.,"Fibrinolysis is the enzymatic degradation of the fibrin mesh that stabilizes blood clots. Experiments have shown that coarse clots made of thick fibres sometimes lyse more quickly than fine clots made of thin fibres, despite the fact that individual thick fibres lyse more slowly than individual thin fibres. This paper aims at using a 1D continuum reaction-diffusion model of fibrinolysis to elucidate the mechanism by which coarse clots lyse more quickly than fine clots. Reaction-diffusion models have been the standard tool for investigating fibrinolysis, and have been successful in capturing the wave-like behaviour of lysis seen in experiments. These previous models treat the distribution of fibrin within a clot as homogeneous, and therefore cannot be used directly to study the lysis of fine and coarse clots. In our model, we include a spatially heterogeneous fibrin concentration, as well as a more accurate description of the role of fibrin as a cofactor in the activation of the lytic enzyme. Our model predicts spatio-temporal protein distributions in reasonable quantitative agreement with experimental data. The model also predicts observed behaviour such as a front of lysis moving through the clot with an accumulation of lytic proteins at the front. In spite of the model improvements, however, we find that 1D continuum models are unable to accurately describe the observed differences in lysis behaviour between fine and coarse clots. Features of the problems that lead to the inaccuracy of 1D continuum models are discussed. We conclude that higher-dimensional, multiscale models are required to investigate the effect of clot structure on lysis behaviour.",2014,"['Bannish, Brittany E', 'Keener, James P', 'Woodbury, Michael', 'Weisel, John W', 'Fogelson, Aaron L']"
Modelling fibrinolysis: a 3D stochastic multiscale model.,"Fibrinolysis, the proteolytic degradation of the fibrin fibres that stabilize blood clots, is initiated when tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) activates plasminogen to plasmin, the main fibrinolytic enzyme. Many experiments have shown that coarse clots made of thick fibres lyse more quickly than fine clots made of thin fibres, despite the fact that individual thick fibres lyse more slowly than individual thin fibres. The generally accepted explanation for this is that a coarse clot with fewer fibres to transect will be degraded faster than a fine clot with a higher fibre density. Other experiments show the opposite result. The standard mathematical tool for investigating fibrinolysis has been deterministic reaction-diffusion models, but due to low tPA concentrations, stochastic models may be more appropriate. We develop a 3D stochastic multiscale model of fibrinolysis. A microscale model representing a fibre cross section and containing detailed biochemical reactions provides information about single fibre lysis times, the number of plasmin molecules that can be activated by a single tPA molecule and the length of time tPA stays bound to a given fibre cross section. Data from the microscale model are used in a macroscale model of the full fibrin clot, from which we obtain lysis front velocities and tPA distributions. We find that the fibre number impacts lysis speed, but so does the number of tPA molecules relative to the surface area of the clot exposed to those molecules. Depending on the values of these two quantities (tPA number and surface area), for given kinetic parameters, the model predicts coarse clots lyse faster or slower than fine clots, thus providing a possible explanation for the divergent experimental observations.",2014,"['Bannish, Brittany E', 'Keener, James P', 'Fogelson, Aaron L']"
Carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-2 decreases fibrinolysis in human plasma.,"Carbon monoxide, derived from carbon monoxide-releasing molecules, has been recently demonstrated to enhance the velocity of formation and strength of plasma thrombi. We tested the hypothesis that carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-2 would modulate fibrinolysis of plasma thrombi. Normal plasma was exposed to 0, 25, 50, 100 or 200 micromol/l carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-2, with coagulation activated with tissue factor and fibrinolysis initiated with tissue-type plasminogen activator. Additional experiments utilized factor XIII, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor or alpha2-antiplasmin-deficient plasmas. Thrombus growth/disintegration kinetics was monitored with thrombelastography. Carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-2, in a concentration-dependent fashion, increased the velocity of thrombus formation and strength, and markedly attenuated fibrinolysis in normal plasma. In factor XIII-deficient plasma, carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-2 mediated effects on thrombus growth/disintegration kinetics were similar to that seen with normal plasma; however, carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-2 had a less marked effect on thrombus growth/disintegration in both plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor-deficient plasma, with even less carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-2-mediated effects noted in alpha2-antiplasmin-deficient plasma. Carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-2 attenuated fibrinolysis by enhancing the velocity of clot growth and strength while augmenting the effects of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor and alpha2-antiplasmin. These findings serve as the rationale for further investigations to determine if carbon monoxide-releasing molecules could be utilized as hemostatic agents.",2009,"['Nielsen, Vance G', 'Kirklin, James K', 'George, James F']"
