Does the diameter of abdominal aortic aneurysm influence late survival following abdominal aortic aneurysm repair? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Studies reporting the influence of preoperative abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter on late survival following abdominal aortic aneurysm repair have not been consistent. To report the influence of abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter on overall long-term survival following abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Embase, Medline and the Cochrane electronic databases were searched to identify articles reporting the influence of abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter on late survival following open aneurysm repair and endovascular aneurysm repair published up to April 2015. Data were extracted from multivariate analysis; estimated risks were expressed as hazard ratio. A total of 2167 titles/abstracts were retrieved, of which 76 studies were fully assessed; 19 studies reporting on 22,104 patients were included. Preoperative larger abdominal aortic aneurysm size was associated with a worse survival compared to smaller aneurysms with a pooled hazard ratio of 1.14 (95% CI: 1.09-1.18), per 1 cm increase in abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter. Subgroup analysis of the different types of repair was performed and the hazard ratio (95% CI), for open aneurysm repair and endovascular aneurysm repair were 1.08 (1.03-1.12) and 1.20 (1.15-1.25), respectively, per 1 cm increase. There was a significant difference between the groups p < 0.02.",2016,"['Khashram, Manar', 'Hider, Phil N', 'Williman, Jonathan A', 'Jones, Gregory T', 'Roake, Justin A']"
Negative association of diabetes with rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysm.,"To summarize the association of diabetes with abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture, we reviewed currently available studies with a systematic literature search and meta-analytic evaluation. To identify all studies reporting the association of diabetes with abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched through July 2015. For each study, data regarding diabetes prevalence in both the ruptured and non-ruptured groups were used to generate an unadjusted odds ratio for abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture and 95% confidence intervals. Alternatively, an unadjusted or adjusted odds ratio, or hazard ratio for abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture with 95% confidence interval was directly abstracted (as available) from each individual study. Our search identified 11 eligible studies. A primary meta-analysis of nine studies reporting data on ruptured (not including non-ruptured symptomatic) abdominal aortic aneurysm demonstrated that diabetes was associated with significantly lower prevalence/incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture (odds ratio/hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.56 to 0.89; p = 0.003). A secondary meta-analysis of all 11 studies (adding two studies in which non-ruptured symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm was included in the rupture group) also demonstrated that diabetes was associated with significantly lower prevalence/incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture (odds ratio/hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.63 to 0.95; p = 0.01).",2016,Error Retrieving
Results of open pararenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair: single centre series and pooled analysis of literature.,"Endovascular treatment of pararenal abdominal aortic aneurysm has gained terrain over the past decade, despite the substantial need for reinterventions during follow-up. However, open repair is still a well-established treatment option. With the current study we report the results of a consecutive series of elective primary open pararenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in a tertiary vascular referral centre, combined with an overview of current literature and pooled data analysis of perioperative mortality of open and endovascular pararenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. A retrospective analysis of a prospective database of all elective open pararenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs in the St. Antonius Hospital between 2005 and 2014 was performed. Primary endpoint was 30-day mortality. Secondary endpoints were 30-day morbidity, new onset dialysis, reintervention free survival, and overall survival during follow-up. Between 2005 and 2014, 214 consecutive patients underwent elective open pararenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Mean age was 69.8 (±7.1) years, 82.7% (177/214) were men, and mean abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter was 62 (±11) mm. Thirty-day mortality was 3.4%. Thirty-day morbidity was 27.1%, which predominantly consisted of pneumonia (18.7% (40/214)), cardiac events (3.3% (7/214)), and new onset dialysis (2.8% (6/214)). Estimated five-year overall survival rate was 74.2%. 0.9% (2/214) of patients required abdominal aortic aneurysm-related reintervention, and an additional 2.3% (5/214) required surgical repair of an incisional hernia. Pooled analysis of literature revealed a 30-day mortality of 3.0% for open pararenal repair and 1.9% for fenestrated endovascular repair.",2016,"['van Lammeren, Guus W', 'Ünlü, Çağdaş', 'Verschoor, Sjoerd', 'van Dongen, Eric P', 'Wille, Jan', 'van de Pavoordt, Eric Dwm', 'de Vries-Werson, Debbie Ab', 'De Vries, Jean-Paul Pm']"
The impact of preoperative statin therapy on open and endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair outcomes.,"This study evaluated the utilization of preoperative statins and their impact on perioperative outcomes in patients undergoing open or endovascular aortic repair. Patients ≥50 years of age with non-ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm repair were identified in MedPAR files 2007-2008 utilizing ICD-9-CM codes. Preoperative statins use was identified using National Drug Codes in Part D. Chi-square test, multivariable logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression modeling were performed. In all, 19,323 patients were identified undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (14,602 endovascular aortic repair and 4721 open aortic repair); 9913 (50.3%) used statins before surgery. Bivariate analysis demonstrated lower rates of hospital, 30-, 90-day and 1-year mortality in patients with statins compared to those without statins after endovascular aortic repair (1.0% vs. 1.45%, p = 0.01; 1.51% vs. 2.3%, p = 0.0004; 3.05% vs. 4.66%, p < 0.0001; 7.91% vs. 11.56%, p < 0.0001, respectively). Multivariable logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, race, comorbidities and procedure demonstrated preoperative statins use was associated with a mortality reduction at 90-days postoperatively (odds ratio = 0.80; 95% CI 0.70-0.91, p = 0.0014) and 1-year postoperatively (odds ratio = 0.76; 95% CI 0.69-0.84, p = 0.0001).",2015,"['Galiñanes, Edgar Luis', 'Reynolds, Shaun', 'Dombrovskiy, Viktor Y', 'Vogel, Todd R']"
Prevention of abdominal aortic aneurysm progression by targeted inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase activity with batimastat-loaded nanoparticles.,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-mediated extracellular matrix destruction is the major cause of development and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Systemic treatments of MMP inhibitors have shown effectiveness in animal models, but it did not translate to clinical success either because of low doses used or systemic side effects of MMP inhibitors. We propose a targeted nanoparticle (NP)-based delivery of MMP inhibitor at low doses to the abdominal aortic aneurysms site. Such therapy will be an attractive option for preventing expansion of aneurysms in patients without systemic side effects. Our previous study showed that poly(d,l-lactide) NPs conjugated with an antielastin antibody could be targeted to the site of an aneurysm in a rat model of abdominal aortic aneurysms. In the study reported here, we tested whether such targeted NPs could deliver the MMP inhibitor batimastat (BB-94) to the site of an aneurysm and prevent aneurysmal growth. Poly(d,l-lactide) NPs were loaded with BB-94 and conjugated with an elastin antibody. Intravenous injections of elastin antibody-conjugated BB-94-loaded NPs targeted the site of aneurysms and delivered BB-94 in a calcium chloride injury-induced abdominal aortic aneurysms in rats. Such targeted delivery inhibited MMP activity, elastin degradation, calcification, and aneurysmal development in the aorta (269% expansion in control versus 40% elastin antibody-conjugated BB-94-loaded NPs) at a low dose of BB-94. The systemic administration of BB-94 alone at the same dose was ineffective in producing MMP inhibition.",2015,"['Nosoudi, Nasim', 'Nahar-Gohad, Pranjal', 'Sinha, Aditi', 'Chowdhury, Aniqa', 'Gerard, Patrick', 'Carsten, Christopher G', 'Gray, Bruce H', 'Vyavahare, Naren R']"
Endovascular treatment of a small infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm causing duodenal obstruction: Case report and literature review.,"Duodenal obstruction caused by abdominal aortic aneurysm was first described by Osler in 1905 and is named ""aortoduodenal syndrome."" This condition has always been treated by open surgical repair. We report the first case of aortoduodenal syndrome successfully treated by endovascular aneurysm repair. A 74-year-old male patient referred to our hospital complaining postprandial vomit, reporting a consistent weight loss in the latest weeks. Enhanced computed tomography scans showed a small saccular abdominal aortic aneurysm compressing duodenum and inferior vena cava without any other evident pathological finding. As the patient underwent a successful endovascular treatment of the abdominal aortic aneurysm, symptoms immediately resolved so that he started back to feed and progressively gained body weight. Despite aortoduodenal syndrome is generally caused by large abdominal aortic aneurysm, this condition has to be suspected also in case of small abdominal aortic aneurysm. Differently from what has been reported in literature, endovascular aneurysm repair could be effective in the treatment of aortoduodenal syndrome.",2015,"['Esposito, Andrea', 'Menna, Danilo', 'Mansour, Wassim', 'Sirignano, Pasqualino', 'Capoccia, Laura', 'Speziale, Francesco']"
Family history of atherosclerotic vascular disease is associated with the presence of abdominal aortic aneurysm.,"We investigated whether family history (FHx) of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) was associated with presence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The study cohort comprised of 696 patients with AAA (70±8 years, 84% men) and 2686 controls (68±10 years, 61% men) recruited from noninvasive vascular and stress electrocardiogram (ECG) laboratories at Mayo Clinic. AAA was defined as a transverse diameter of abdominal aorta ⩾ 3 cm or history of AAA repair. Controls were not known to have AAA. FHx was defined as having at least one first-degree relative with aortic aneurysm or with onset of ASCVD (coronary, cerebral or peripheral artery disease) before age 65 years. FHx of aortic aneurysm or ASCVD were each associated with presence of AAA after adjustment for age, sex, conventional risk factors and ASCVD: adjusted odds ratios (OR; 95% confidence interval): 2.17 (1.66-2.83, p < 0.01) and 1.31 (1.08-1.59, p < 0.01), respectively. FHx of ASCVD remained associated with AAA after additional adjustment for FHx of aortic aneurysm: adjusted OR: 1.27 (1.05-1.55, p = 0.01). FHx of ASCVD in multiple arterial locations was associated with higher odds of having AAA: the adjusted odds were 1.23 times higher for each additionally affected arterial location reported in the FHx (1.08-1.40, p = 0.01). Our results suggest both unique and shared environmental and genetic factors mediating susceptibility to AAA and ASCVD.",2016,"['Ye, Zi', 'Bailey, Kent R', 'Austin, Erin', 'Kullo, Iftikhar J']"
CXCR4: A Potential Marker for Inflammatory Activity in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Wall.,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential role of chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12 in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). AAA tissue specimens were obtained from the anterior or lateral aneurysm sac of patients (n = 32, 26 males, 6 females; 66.8 ± 11.2 years, diameter 64.4 ± 17.0 mm), who underwent elective open surgical repair. Twelve non-aneurysmal aortic specimens from transplant donors served as controls. Expression analysis of CXCR4 and CXCL12 at mRNA and protein level was determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot. Immunohistochemical staining of corresponding histological sections for CD3 (T-cells), CD20 (B-cells), and CD68 (macrophages) was performed to determine the cellular localization of CXCR4 and CXCL12. Data were analyzed with SPSS 20.0 using Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Gene expression of CXCR4 and CXCL12 was 9.6 and 4.6 fold higher in AAA than in non-aneurysmal aorta (p = .0004 and p < .0001, respectively). Likewise, the protein level of CXCR4 was increased 3.2 fold in AAA wall compared with non-aneurysmal aortic tissue (p < .0001), although CXCL12 could not be detected. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that CXCR4 was expressed in B and T lymphocytes and macrophages, and CXCL12 was observed only in plasma cells.",2015,"['Tanios, F', 'Pelisek, J', 'Lutz, B', 'Reutersberg, B', 'Matevossian, E', 'Schwamborn, K', 'Hösel, V', 'Eckstein, H-H', 'Reeps, C']"
Membrane-Bound Thrombomodulin Regulates Macrophage Inflammation in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.,"Thrombomodulin (TM), a glycoprotein constitutively expressed in the endothelium, is well known for its anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory properties. Paradoxically, we recently found that monocytic membrane-bound TM (ie, endogenous TM expression in monocytes) triggers lipopolysaccharide- and gram-negative bacteria-induced inflammatory responses. However, the significance of membrane-bound TM in chronic sterile vascular inflammation and the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains undetermined. Implicating a potential role for membrane-bound TM in AAA, we found that TM signals were predominantly localized to macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells in human aneurysm specimens. Characterization of the CaCl2-induced AAA in mice revealed that during aneurysm development, TM expression was mainly localized in infiltrating macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells. To investigate the function of membrane-bound TM in vivo, transgenic mice with myeloid- (LysMcre/TM(flox/flox)) and vascular smooth muscle cell-specific (SM22-cre(tg)/TM(flox/flox)) TM ablation and their respective wild-type controls (TM(flox/flox) and SM22-cre(tg)/TM(+/+)) were generated. In the mouse CaCl2-induced AAA model, deficiency of myeloid TM, but not vascular smooth muscle cell TM, inhibited macrophage accumulation, attenuated proinflammatory cytokine and matrix metalloproteinase-9 production, and finally mitigated elastin destruction and aortic dilatation. In vitro TM-deficient monocytes/macrophages, versus TM wild-type counterparts, exhibited attenuation of proinflammatory mediator expression, adhesion to endothelial cells, and generation of reactive oxygen species. Consistently, myeloid TM-deficient hyperlipidemic mice (ApoE(-/-)/LysMcre/TM(flox/flox)) were resistant to AAA formation induced by angiotensin II infusion, along with reduced macrophage infiltration, suppressed matrix metalloproteinase activities, and diminished oxidative stress.",2015,"['Wang, Kuan-Chieh', 'Li, Yi-Heng', 'Shi, Guey-Yueh', 'Tsai, Hung-Wen', 'Luo, Chawn-Yau', 'Cheng, Min-Hua', 'Ma, Chih-Yuan', 'Hsu, Yun-Yan', 'Cheng, Tsung-Lin', 'Chang, Bi-Ing', 'Lai, Chao-Han', 'Wu, Hua-Lin']"
A peptide antagonist of thrombospondin-1 promotes abdominal aortic aneurysm progression in the angiotensin II-infused apolipoprotein-E-deficient mouse.,"Interaction of the activating sequence in thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) with the conserved sequence (leucine-serine-lysine-leucine [LSKL]) in the latency-associated peptide region of latent transforming growth factor (TGF)-β complex is important in regulating TGF-β1 activity. We aimed to assess the effect of blocking peptide LSKL on the progression of pre-established abdominal aortic aneurysm in angiotensin II-infused apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice. Abdominal aortic aneurysm was established in 3-month-old male ApoE(-/-) mice with subcutaneous infusion of angiotensin II for 28 days. After this, mice received LSKL peptide or control SLLK (serine-leucine-leucine-lysine) peptide (4 mg/kg) via daily intraperitoneal injection for an additional 2 weeks. Administration of LSKL peptide promoted larger suprarenal aortic diameter, as determined by ultrasound and morphometric analysis, and stimulated more severe atherosclerosis within the aortic arch. In addition, mice receiving LSKL peptide exhibited elevated circulating proinflammatory cytokine levels and greater inflammatory cells within the suprarenal aorta compared with controls. Mice receiving LSKL peptide showed low plasma TGF-β1 activity and low levels of aortic tissue phosphorylated to total Smad2/3. Aortic gene expression of TGF-β receptor 1 (TGFBRI) and receptor 2 (TGFBRII), but not TGF-β1 and thrombospondin-1, were lower in mice receiving LSKL peptide than controls. LSKL peptide administration was associated with greater aortic elastin fragmentation and lower expression and activity of the TGF-β1-target gene lysyl oxidase like 1 (LOXL1).",2015,"['Krishna, Smriti M', 'Seto, Sai Wang', 'Jose, Roby J', 'Biros, Erik', 'Moran, Corey S', 'Wang, Yutang', 'Clancy, Paula', 'Golledge, Jonathan']"
Background differences in baseline and stimulated MMP levels influence abdominal aortic aneurysm susceptibility.,"Evidence has demonstrated profound influence of genetic background on cardiovascular phenotypes. Murine models in Marfan syndrome (MFS) have shown that genetic background-related variations affect thoracic aortic aneurysm formation, rupture, and lifespan of mice. MFS mice with C57Bl/6 genetic background are less susceptible to aneurysm formation compared to the 129/SvEv genetic background. In this study, we hypothesize that susceptibility to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) will be increased in 129/SvEv mice versus C57Bl/6 mice. We tested this hypothesis by assessing differences in aneurysm size, tissue properties, immune response, and MMP expression. Mice of C57Bl/6 or 129/SvEv background underwent AAA induction by periaortic application of CaCl2. Baseline aortic diameters, tissue properties and MMP levels were measured. After aneurysm induction, diameters, MMP expression, and immune response (macrophage infiltration and bone marrow transplantation) were measured. Aneurysms were larger in 129/SvEv mice than C57Bl/6 mice (83.0% ± 13.6 increase compared to 57.8% ± 6.4). The aorta was stiffer in the 129/SvEv mice compared to C57Bl/6 mice (952.5 kPa ± 93.6 versus 621.4 kPa ± 84.2). Baseline MMP-2 and post-aneurysm MMP-2 and -9 levels were higher in 129/SvEv aortas compared to C57Bl/6 aortas. Elastic lamella disruption/fragmentation and macrophage infiltration were increased in 129/SvEv mice. Myelogenous cell reversal by bone marrow transplantation did not affect aneurysm size.",2015,"['Dale, Matthew A', 'Suh, Melissa K', 'Zhao, Shijia', 'Meisinger, Trevor', 'Gu, Linxia', 'Swier, Vicki J', 'Agrawal, Devendra K', 'Greiner, Timothy C', 'Carson, Jeffrey S', 'Baxter, B Timothy', 'Xiong, Wanfen']"
Long-term outcomes and factors influencing late survival following elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair: A 24-year experience.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysms can be either treated by an open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair or an endovascular repair. Comparing clinical predictors of outcomes and those which influence survival rates in the long term is important in determining the choice of treatment offered and the decision-making process with patients. To determine the influence of pre-existing clinical predictors and perioperative determinants on late survival of elective open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and endovascular repair at a tertiary hospital. Consecutive patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair from 1990 to 2013 were included. Data were collected from a prospectively acquired database and death data were gathered from the Queensland state death registry. Pre-existing risks and perioperative factors were assessed independently. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression modeling were performed. During the study period, 1340 abdominal aortic aneurysms were repaired electively, of which 982 were open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The average age was 72.4 years old and 81.7% were males. The cumulative percentage survival rates for open abdominal aortic aneurysms repair at 5, 10, 15 and 20 years were 79, 49, 31 and 22, respectively. The corresponding 5-, 10- and 15-year survival rates for endovascular repair were not significantly different at 75, 49 and 33%, respectively (P = 0.75). Predictors of reduced survival were advanced age, American Society of Anaesthesiology scores, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal impairment, bifurcated grafts, peripheral vascular disease and congestive heart failure.",2016,"['Khashram, Manar', 'Jenkins, Julie S', 'Jenkins, Jason', 'Kruger, Allan J', 'Boyne, Nicholas S', 'Foster, Wallace J', 'Walker, Philip J']"
Midterm Re-interventions and Survival After Endovascular Versus Open Repair for Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.,"To compare the midterm re-intervention and survival rates after EVAR and OR for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAA). Observational cohort study including all consecutive RAAA patients between 2004 and 2011 in 10 hospitals in the Amsterdam ambulance region. The primary end point was re-interventions within 5 years of the primary intervention. The secondary end point was death. The outcomes were estimated by survival analyses, compared using the logrank test, and subsequently adjusted for possible confounders using Cox proportional hazard models. Re-interventions were estimated in all patients and in patients who survived their hospital stay. Of 467 patients with a RAAA, 73 were treated by EVAR and 394 by OR. Five years after the primary intervention, the rates of freedom from re-intervention were 55% for EVAR (26/73, 95% CI: 41-69%) and 60% for OR (130/394, 95% CI: 55-66%) (p = .96). After adjustment for age, sex, comorbidity, and pre-operative hemodynamic stability, the risk of re-intervention was similar (HR 1.01, 95% CI: 0.65-1.55). The survival rates were 36% for EVAR (45/73, 95% CI: 24-47%) and 38% for OR (235/394, 95% CI: 33-43%) (p = .83). In 297 patients who survived their hospital stay, the rates of freedom from re-intervention were 66% for EVAR (15/54, 95% CI: 52-81%) and 90% for OR (20/243, 95% CI: 86-95%) (p < .01). After adjustment for age and sex, the risk of re-intervention was higher after EVAR (HR 0.27, 95% CI: 0.14-0.52).",2015,Error Retrieving
ApoA-I/HDL-C levels are inversely associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm progression.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) evolution is unpredictable, and there is no therapy except surgery for patients with an aortic size> 5 cm (large AAA). We aimed to identify new potential biomarkers that could facilitate prognosis and treatment of patients with AAA. A differential quantitative proteomic analysis of plasma proteins was performed in AAA patients at different stages of evolution [small AAA (aortic size=3-5 cm) vs large AAA] using iTRAQ labelling, high-throughput nano-LC-MS/MS and a novel multi-layered statistical model. Among the proteins identified, ApoA-I was decreased in patients with large AAA compared to those with small AAA. These results were validated by ELISA on plasma samples from small (n=90) and large AAA (n=26) patients (150± 3 vs 133± 5 mg/dl, respectively, p< 0.001). ApoA-I levels strongly correlated with HDL-Cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration (r=0.9, p< 0.001) and showed a negative correlation with aortic size (r=-0.4, p< 0.01) and thrombus volume (r=-0.3, p< 0.01), which remained significant after adjusting for traditional risk factors. In a prospective study, HDL-C independently predicted aneurysmal growth rate in multiple linear regression analysis (n=122, p=0.008) and was inversely associated with need for surgical repair (Adjusted hazard ratio: 0.18, 95 % confidence interval: 0.04-0.74, p=0.018). In a nation-wide Danish registry, we found lower mean HDL-C concentration in large AAA patients (n=6,560) compared with patients with aorto-iliac occlusive disease (n=23,496) (0.89± 2.99 vs 1.59± 5.74 mmol/l, p< 0.001). Finally, reduced mean aortic AAA diameter was observed in AngII-infused mice treated with ApoA-I mimetic peptide compared with saline-injected controls. In conclusion, ApoA-I/HDL-C systemic levels are negatively associated with AAA evolution. Therapies targeting HDL functionality could halt AAA formation.",2015,"['Burillo, Elena', 'Lindholt, Jes S', 'Molina-Sánchez, Pedro', 'Jorge, Immaculada', 'Martinez-Pinna, Roxana', 'Blanco-Colio, Luis Miguel', 'Tarin, Carlos', 'Torres-Fonseca, Monica Maria', 'Esteban, Margarita', 'Laustsen, Jesper', 'Ramos-Mozo, Priscilla', 'Calvo, Enrique', 'Lopez, Juan Antonio', 'Vega de Ceniga, Melina', 'Michel, Jean-Baptiste', 'Egido, Jesus', 'Andrés, Vicente', 'Vazquéz, Jesús', 'Meilhac, Olivier', 'Martin-Ventura, Jose Luis']"
Ginsenoside Rb1 attenuates angiotensin II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm through inactivation of the JNK and p38 signaling pathways.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), a life-threatening vascular disease, accounts for approximately 10% of the morbidity in people over 65 years old. No satisfactory approach is available to treat AAA. Ginsenosides Rb1 and Rg1 are primary ingredients of Panax notoginseng for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, but their impact on AAA is unknown. An AAA model was established using an Ang II infusion in ApoE(-/-) mice. After continuous stimulation of Ang II for 28 days, suprarenal aortic aneurysms developed in 77% mice and 12% mice died suddenly due to AAA rupture. Administration of ginsenoside Rb1 (20 mg/kg/day), but not ginsenoside Rg1, significantly reduced the incidence and mortality of AAA. Ginsenoside Rb1 treatment dramatically suppressed Ang II-induced diameter enlargement, extracellular matrix degradation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) production, inflammatory cell infiltration, and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dysfunction. Mechanistic studies indicated that the protective effects of ginsenoside Rb1 were associated with the inactivation of JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. A specific activator of JNK and p38, anisomycin, nearly abolished ginsenoside Rb1-driven suppression of MMP secretion by VSMCs.",2015,"['Zhang, Xiao-Jing', 'He, Chengwei', 'Tian, Ke', 'Li, Peng', 'Su, Huanxing', 'Wan, Jian-Bo']"
Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) contributes to the development of vascular inflammation by regulating monocytic cell motility in mouse models of abdominal aortic aneurysm.,"Histological examination of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) tissues demonstrates extracellular matrix destruction and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Previous work with mouse models of AAA has shown that anti-inflammatory strategies can effectively attenuate aneurysm formation. Thrombospondin-1 is a matricellular protein involved in the maintenance of vascular structure and homeostasis through the regulation of biological functions, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and adhesion. Expression levels of thrombospondin-1 correlate with vascular disease conditions. To use thrombospondin-1-deficient (Thbs1(-/-)) mice to test the hypothesis that thrombospondin-1 contributes to pathogenesis of AAAs. Mouse experimental AAA was induced through perivascular treatment with calcium phosphate, intraluminal perfusion with porcine elastase, or systemic administration of angiotensin II. Induction of AAA increased thrombospondin-1 expression in aortas of C57BL/6 or apoE-/- mice. Compared with Thbs1(+/+) mice, Thbs1(-/-) mice developed significantly smaller aortic expansion when subjected to AAA inductions, which was associated with diminished infiltration of macrophages. Thbs1(-/-) monocytic cells had reduced adhesion and migratory capacity in vitro compared with wild-type counterparts. Adoptive transfer of Thbs1(+/+) monocytic cells or bone marrow reconstitution rescued aneurysm development in Thbs1(-/-) mice.",2015,"['Liu, Zhenjie', 'Morgan, Stephanie', 'Ren, Jun', 'Wang, Qiwei', 'Annis, Douglas S', 'Mosher, Deane F', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Sorenson, Christine M', 'Sheibani, Nader', 'Liu, Bo']"
Surrogate Markers of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Progression.,"The natural course of many abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is to gradually expand and eventually rupture and monitoring the disease progression is essential to their management. In this publication, we review surrogate markers of AAA progression. AAA diameter remains the most widely used and important marker of AAA growth. Standardized reporting of reproducible methods of measuring AAA diameter is essential. Newer imaging assessments, such as volume measurements, biomechanical analyses, and functional and molecular imaging, as well as circulating biomarkers, have potential to add important information about AAA progression. Currently, however, there is insufficient evidence to recommend their routine use in clinical practice.",2016,"['Wanhainen, Anders', 'Mani, Kevin', 'Golledge, Jonathan']"
High Resolution Strain Analysis Comparing Aorta and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm with Real Time Three Dimensional Speckle Tracking Ultrasound.,"Ultrasound measurement of aortic diameter for aneurysm screening allows supervision of aneurysm growth. Additional biomechanical analysis of wall motion and aneurysm deformation can supply information about individual elastic properties and the pathological state of the aortic wall. Local aortic wall motion was analyzed through imaged aortic segments according to age and pathology. Sixty-five patients were examined with a commercial four dimensional ultrasound system (4D-US). Three groups were defined: patients with normal aortic diameter and younger than 60 years of age (n = 21); those with normal aortic diameter and older than 60 years of age (n = 25); and those with infrarenal aortic aneurysm (n = 19). A diastolic reference shape of aortic wall segments was obtained and local and temporally resolved wall strain was determined. Indices characterizing the resulting wall strain distribution were determined. The analysis of biomechanical properties displayed increasing heterogeneous and dyssynchronous circumferential strain with increasing patient age. Young patients exhibited higher mean strain amplitude. The distribution of the spatial heterogeneity index and local strain ratio was inversely proportional to age. The maximum local strain amplitude was significantly higher in the young (0.26 ± 0.17) compared with the old (0.16 ± 0.07) or aneurysmal aorta (0.16 ± 0.10). Temporal dyssynchrony significantly differed between young (0.13 ± 0.10) and old (aneurysmal 0.31 ± 0.04, non-aneurysmal 0.29 ± 0.05), regardless of aortic diameter. The spatial heterogeneity index and local strain ratio differentiate non-aneurysmal and aneurysmal aorta, regardless of age.",2016,"['Derwich, W', 'Wittek, A', 'Pfister, K', 'Nelson, K', 'Bereiter-Hahn, J', 'Fritzen, C P', 'Blase, C', 'Schmitz-Rixen, T']"
Platelet Inhibitors Reduce Rupture in a Mouse Model of Established Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.,"Rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms causes a high morbidity and mortality in the elderly population. Platelet-rich thrombi form on the surface of aneurysms and may contribute to disease progression. In this study, we used a pharmacological approach to examine a role of platelets in established aneurysms induced by angiotensin II infusion into hypercholesterolemic mice. Administration of the platelet inhibitors aspirin or clopidogrel bisulfate to established abdominal aortic aneurysms dramatically reduced rupture. These platelet inhibitors reduced abdominal aortic platelet and macrophage recruitment resulting in decreased active matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9. Platelet inhibitors also resulted in reduced plasma concentrations of platelet factor 4, cytokines, and components of the plasminogen activation system in mice. To determine the validity of these findings in human subjects, a cohort of aneurysm patients were retrospectively analyzed using developed and validated algorithms in the electronic medical record database at Vanderbilt University.

TElmisartan in the management of abDominal aortic aneurYsm (TEDY): The study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"Experimental studies suggest that angiotensin II plays a central role in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm. This trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of the angiotensin receptor blocker telmisartan in limiting the progression of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Telmisartan in the management of abdominal aortic aneurysm (TEDY) is a multicentre, parallel-design, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with an intention-to-treat analysis. We aim to randomly assign 300 participants with small abdominal aortic aneurysm to either 40 mg of telmisartan or identical placebo and follow patients over 2 years. The primary endpoint will be abdominal aortic aneurysm growth as measured by 1) maximum infra-renal aortic volume on computed tomographic angiography, 2) maximum orthogonal diameter on computed tomographic angiography, and 3) maximum diameter on ultrasound. Secondary endpoints include change in resting brachial blood pressure, abdominal aortic aneurysm biomarker profile and health-related quality of life. TEDY is an international collaboration conducted from major vascular centres in Australia, the United States and the Netherlands. Currently, no medication has been convincingly demonstrated to limit abdominal aortic aneurysm progression. TEDY will examine the potential of a promising treatment strategy for patients with small abdominal aortic aneurysms.",2015,"['Morris, Dylan R', 'Cunningham, Margaret A', 'Ahimastos, Anna A', 'Kingwell, Bronwyn A', 'Pappas, Elise', 'Bourke, Michael', 'Reid, Christopher M', 'Stijnen, Theo', 'Dalman, Ronald L', 'Aalami, Oliver O', 'Lindeman, Jan H', 'Norman, Paul E', 'Walker, Philip J', 'Fitridge, Robert', 'Bourke, Bernie', 'Dear, Anthony E', 'Pinchbeck, Jenna', 'Jaeggi, Rene', 'Golledge, Jonathan']"
Advanced complicated diabetes mellitus is associated with a reduced risk of thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture: a population-based cohort study.,"Studies have associated diabetes mellitus (DM) with the reduced risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm and thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection. We used the national insurance data of Taiwan to examine these correlations for an Asian population. The association was also evaluated by DM severity. We identified 160,391 patients with type 2 DM diagnosed from 1998 to 2008 and 646,710 comparison subjects without DM, frequency matched by diagnosis date, sex and age (mainly the elderly). The DM severity was partitioned into advanced and uncomplicated status according to DM-related comorbidities. By the end of 2010, the overall pooled incidence rate of thoracic aortic aneurysm and abdominal aortic aneurysm was 15% lower in the type 2 DM cohort than in non-DM cohort, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.64 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56-0.74] in the multivariable Cox model. Patients with advanced type 2 DM were significantly associated with reduced thoracic aortic aneurysm rupture and abdominal aortic aneurysm without rupture, with adjusted hazard ratios of 0.50 (95% CI 0.35-0.71) and 0.53 (95% CI 0.40-0.69), respectively. Uncomplicated type 2 DM was also associated with reduced abdominal aortic aneurysm without rapture (aHR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.45-0.74).",2015,"['Tsai, Chung-Lin', 'Lin, Cheng-Li', 'Wu, Yi-Ying', 'Shieh, Dong-Chen', 'Sung, Fung-Chang', 'Kao, Chia-Hung']"
Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and aortoiliac vein fistula.,"A 67-year-old man was admitted with severe abdominal pain and back pain. Computed tomography showed an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (8.4 × 8.3 cm) and a large retroperitoneal hematoma. Immediately afterwards, the patient suffered circulatory collapse and was rushed to the operating theater. A fistula communicating with the left iliac vein was found. It was repaired with a Dacron patch while balloon-tipped catheters controlled the bleeding. The abdominal aortic aneurysm was replaced with a bifurcated graft. The postoperative course was uneventful.

Regulatory T cells prevent angiotensin II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm in apolipoprotein E knockout mice.,"To test the hypothesis that adoptive transfer of regulatory T cells (Tregs) may dose-dependently inhibit the formation of angiotensin II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm in apolipoprotein E knockout mice, we established an animal model of abdominal aortic aneurysm by angiotensin II infusion in apolipoprotein E knockout mice. Then mice received different treatment with PBS, low-dose Tregs, high-dose Tregs, or CD25-depleting PC61 antibody. Histopathologic analysis showed that the incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm was 80%, 76%, 27%, and 71% in the PBS, low-dose Tregs, high-dose Tregs, and PC61 groups, respectively. Tregs treatment markedly decreased macrophage and CD4+ T-cell infiltration and preserved the medial smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, Tregs decreased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9, increased the expression of anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-β, and suppressed apoptosis and oxidative stress. In vitro, Tregs inhibited the response of human aortic smooth muscle cells to angiotensin II and reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, MMP-2 and MMP-9, possibly by inhibiting the activation of nuclear factor-κB and extracellular signal-regulate kinase 1/2. In addition, Tregs downregulated macrophage type 1-related genes and upregulated macrophage type 2-related genes. However, Tregs-mediated effects were largely reversed by disrupting cell-cell contact or using neutralizing antibodies against interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-β. Adoptive transfer of Tregs dose-dependently prevents angiotensin II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm in apolipoprotein E knockout mice. The mechanisms may involve declined proinflammatory cytokine expression and MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels and enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokine expression, which is mediated by direct cell-cell contact and soluble mediators.",2014,"['Meng, Xiao', 'Yang, Jianmin', 'Zhang, Kai', 'An, Guipeng', 'Kong, Jing', 'Jiang, Fan', 'Zhang, Yun', 'Zhang, Cheng']"
One-stage Procedure for Concomitant Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm and Gastric Cancer.,"A concise surgical strategy for concomitant abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and operable gastric cancer remains unknown. We assessed a one-stage procedure that included endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) and gastric resection. Forteen patients who underwent surgery for an infrarenal AAA and gastric cancer between 1990 and 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic characteristics, aneurysm size, comorbid conditions, length of postoperative hospital stay, complications within 30 days of surgery, and survival in patients in EVAR (n=4) were compared against patients who had an open AAA repair (n=10). Demographic characteristics, aneurysm size, and comorbid conditions were similar in the EVAR and open-AAA-repair group. The mean length of hospitalization was significantly shorter in the EVAR group (15.2 days vs. 34.9 days; p=0.005), and the rate of postoperative complications was significantly lower (p<0.05). The overall survival rates in the EVAR and open-AAA-repair groups were, respectively, 100% and 80% at 1 year and 75% and 60% at 3 years; the differences between groups were not significant (p=0.788).",2015,"['Matsumoto, Takuya', 'Matsuda, Daisuke', 'Honma, Kenichi', 'Aoyagi, Yukihiko', 'Okadome, Jun', 'Morisaki, Koichi', 'Tanaka, Shinichi', 'Saeki, Hiroshi', 'Oki, Eiji', 'Maehara, Yoshihiko']"
The impact of abdominal aortic aneurysm on muscle mass and energy expenditure: A novel preliminary investigation.,"Vascular surgical patients, including those with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), are nutritionally vulnerable. The aim of this study was to compare resting energy expenditure (REE) of patients with AAA relative to age- and gender-matched controls and explore relationships between aneurysm size and muscle mass. Twenty patients with AAA underwent assessment of REE using indirect calorimetry. Mid-arm circumference and triceps skinfold thickness were measured and corrected arm muscle area calculated. Twenty gender- and age-matched controls were assessed using the same procedures. Mean (SD) age of participants with AAA was 74.7 (7.7) years, size of AAA ranged from 45 to 70 mm. Median (IQR) REE was significantly higher than controls [5990 (5469, 7017) kJ/day versus 5086 (4536, 5886) kJ/day, p = .011; or 69 (64, 80) kJ/kg/day versus 66 (61, 69) kJ/kg/day, p = .046]. While weight-adjusted REE was independent of aneurysm size (r = .200; p = .397), as aneurysm size increased, weight-adjusted corrected arm muscle area decreased (r = -.576; p = .008).",2015,"['Delaney, C L', 'Miller, M D', 'Allan, R B', 'Spark, J I']"
Utility of ⁹⁹mTc-human serum albumin diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid SPECT for evaluating endoleak after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.,"The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of (99m)Tc-human serum albumin diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid ((99m)Tc-HSAD) SPECT in the detection of endoleaks after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Fifteen patients (11 men, four women) with aneurysm sac expansion of 5 mm or greater after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair underwent three-phase CT, (99m)Tc-HSAD SPECT, and CT during aortography. Sensitivity calculations for three-phase CT and (99m)Tc-HSAD SPECT were performed with CT during aortography as the reference standard. The volume of each endoleak was measured with CT during aortography. Seven subjects underwent embolization with N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA)-Lipiodol (ethiodized oil, Guerbet and metallic coils. Three-phase CT and (99m)Tc-HSAD SPECT were repeated after embolization to assess their efficacy. Endoleaks were interpreted as perigraft radioisotope accumulation in 12 patients (80.0%) on (99m)Tc-HSAD SPECT images, in 13 patients (86.7%) on three-phase CT images, and in 15 patients (100%) on CT during aortography. The mean endoleak volume visualized with (99m)Tc-HSAD SPECT was 8.37 cm(3) (range, 5.2-15.1 cm(3)), and the volume not visualized was 3.47 cm(3) (2.5-4.6 cm(3)), a statistically significant difference (p = 0.019). In two patients, (99m)Tc-HSAD SPECT depicted endoleaks evident at delayed phase CT during aortography but not at three-phase CT, suggesting they were slow-filling endoleaks. Accumulation of (99m)Tc-HSAD corresponding to endoleaks disappeared after embolization, but CT evaluation of embolization was impeded by artifacts of NBCA-Lipiodol and metallic coils.",2015,"['Nakai, Motoki', 'Sato, Hirotatsu', 'Sato, Morio', 'Ikoma, Akira', 'Sonomura, Tetsuo', 'Nishimura, Yoshiharu', 'Okamura, Yoshitaka']"
Abdominal aortic aneurysm.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm refers to abdominal aortic dilation of 3.0 cm or greater. The main risk factors are age older than 65 years, male sex, and smoking history. Other risk factors include a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, coronary artery disease, hypertension, peripheral artery disease, and previous myocardial infarction. Diagnosis may be made by physical examination, an incidental finding on imaging, or ultrasonography. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force released updated recommendations for abdominal aortic aneurysm screening in 2014. Men 65 to 75 years of age with a history of smoking should undergo one-time screening with ultrasonography based on evidence that screening will improve abdominal aortic aneurysm-related mortality in this population. Men in this age group without a history of smoking may benefit if they have other risk factors (e.g., family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, other vascular aneurysms, coronary artery disease). There is inconclusive evidence to recommend screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in women 65 to 75 years of age with a smoking history. Women without a smoking history should not undergo screening because the harms likely outweigh the benefits. Persons who have a stable abdominal aortic aneurysm should undergo regular surveillance or operative intervention depending on aneurysm size. Surgical intervention by open or endovascular repair is the primary option and is typically reserved for aneurysms 5.5 cm in diameter or greater. There are limited options for medical treatment beyond risk factor modification. Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is a medical emergency presenting with hypotension, shooting abdominal or back pain, and a pulsatile abdominal mass. It is associated with high prehospitalization mortality. Emergent surgical intervention is indicated for a rupture but has a high operative mortality rate.",2015,"['Keisler, Brian', 'Carter, Chuck']"
Pharmacological inhibitor of notch signaling stabilizes the progression of small abdominal aortic aneurysm in a mouse model.,"The progression of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) involves a sustained influx of proinflammatory macrophages, which exacerbate tissue injury by releasing cytokines, chemokines, and matrix metalloproteinases. Previously, we showed that Notch deficiency reduces the development of AAA in the angiotensin II-induced mouse model by preventing infiltration of macrophages. Here, we examined whether Notch inhibition in this mouse model prevents progression of small AAA and whether these effects are associated with altered macrophage differentiation. Treatment with pharmacological Notch inhibitor (DAPT [N-(N-[3,5-difluorophenacetyl]-L-alanyl)-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester]) at day 3 or 8 of angiotensin II infusion arrested the progression of AAA in Apoe(-/-) mice, as demonstrated by a decreased luminal diameter and aortic width. The abdominal aortas of Apoe(-/-) mice treated with DAPT showed decreased expression of matrix metalloproteinases and presence of elastin precursors including tropoelastin and hyaluronic acid. Marginal adventitial thickening observed in the aorta of DAPT-treated Apoe(-/-) mice was not associated with increased macrophage content, as observed in the mice treated with angiotensin II alone. Instead, DAPT-treated abdominal aortas showed increased expression of Cd206-positive M2 macrophages and decreased expression of Il12-positive M1 macrophages. Notch1 deficiency promoted M2 differentiation of macrophages by upregulating transforming growth factor β2 in bone marrow-derived macrophages at basal levels and in response to IL4. Protein expression of transforming growth factor β2 and its downstream effector pSmad2 also increased in DAPT-treated Apoe(-/-) mice, indicating a potential link between Notch and transforming growth factor β2 signaling in the M2 differentiation of macrophages.",2014,"['Cheng, Jeeyun', 'Koenig, Sara N', 'Kuivaniemi, Helena S', 'Garg, Vidu', 'Hans, Chetan P']"
Late Rupture of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm After Previous Endovascular Repair: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"To report a systematic literature review of late rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and the results of a pooled analysis of causes, treatment, and outcomes. Electronic information sources and bibliographic reference lists were interrogated using a combination of free text and controlled vocabulary searches; 11 articles were ultimately identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The articles reported a total of 190 patients who were included in the qualitative and quantitative synthesis. Mortality within 30 days or during the admission with aneurysm rupture was a primary endpoint; major perioperative morbidity was a secondary endpoint. A meta-analysis was performed for 30-day/in-hospital mortality using the random effects model. A total of 152 ruptures occurred after 16,974 EVAR procedures reported by 8 of the case series, giving an incidence of 0.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 1.05]. The mean time to rupture was 37 months. Twenty-nine percent (95% CI 20 to 39) of the patients had at least one previous secondary endovascular intervention following the initial EVAR, and 37% (95% CI 30 to 45) were not compliant with surveillance. Type I and III endoleaks were the predominant causes of rupture. Open surgical treatment was undertaken in 61% (95% CI 53 to 68) of the patients who underwent treatment. The pooled estimate for perioperative mortality was 32% (95% CI 24 to 41). A significantly lower mortality was found with endovascular treatment than open surgical management (p=0.027).",2015,"['Antoniou, George A', 'Georgiadis, George S', 'Antoniou, Stavros A', 'Neequaye, Simon', 'Brennan, John A', 'Torella, Francesco', 'Vallabhaneni, S Rao']"

Advancements in identifying biomechanical determinants for abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysms are a common health problem and currently the need for surgical intervention is determined based on maximum diameter and growth rate criteria. Since these universal variables often fail to predict accurately every abdominal aortic aneurysms evolution, there is a considerable effort in the literature for other markers to be identified towards individualized rupture risk estimations and growth rate predictions. To this effort, biomechanical tools have been extensively used since abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture is in fact a material failure of the diseased arterial wall to compensate the stress acting on it. The peak wall stress, the role of the unique geometry of every individual abdominal aortic aneurysm as well as the mechanical properties and the local strength of the degenerated aneurysmal wall, all confer to rupture risk. In this review article, the assessment of these variables through mechanical testing, advanced imaging and computational modeling is reviewed and the clinical perspective is discussed.",2015,"['Kontopodis, Nikolaos', 'Metaxa, Eleni', 'Papaharilaou, Yannis', 'Tavlas, Emmanouil', 'Tsetis, Dimitrios', 'Ioannou, Christos']"
Angiotensin II mobilizes spleen monocytes to promote the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm in Apoe-/- mice.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is widespread among elderly people and results in progressive expansion and rupture of the aorta with high mortality. Macrophages, which are the main population observed within the site of aneurysm, are thought to derive from circulating monocytes although no direct evidence has been provided to date. In this study, we were particularly interested in understanding the trafficking behavior of monocyte subsets in AAA and their role in disease pathogenesis. Using bone marrow transplantation in Apoe(-/-) mice, we showed that circulating monocytes give rise to abdominal aortic macrophages in hypercholesterolemic mice submitted to angiotensin II (AngII). Detailed monitoring of monocyte compartmentalization revealed that lymphocyte antigen 6C(high) and lymphocyte antigen 6C(low) monocytes transiently increase in blood early after AngII infusion and differentially infiltrate the abdominal aorta. The splenic reservoir accounted for the mobilization of the 2 monocyte subsets after 3 days of AngII infusion. Spleen removal or lymphocyte deficiency in Apoe(-/-) Rag2(-/-) mice similarly impaired early monocyte increase in blood in response to AngII and protected against AAA development, independently of blood pressure. Reconstitution of Apoe(-/-) Rag2(-/-) mice with total splenocytes but not with B-cell-depleted splenocytes restored monocyte mobilization in response to AngII and enhanced susceptibility to AAA.",2015,"['Mellak, Safa', 'Ait-Oufella, Hafid', 'Esposito, Bruno', 'Loyer, Xavier', 'Poirier, Maxime', 'Tedder, Thomas F', 'Tedgui, Alain', 'Mallat, Ziad', 'Potteaux, Stéphane']"
A decision aid regarding treatment options for patients with an asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm: a randomised clinical trial.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm patients tend to be informed inconsistently and incompletely about their disorder and the treatment options open to them. The objective of this trial was to evaluate whether these patients are better informed and experience less decisional conflict regarding their treatment options after viewing a decision aid. A six-centre, randomised clinical trial comparing a decision aid plus regular information versus regular information from the surgeon. Included patients had recently been diagnosed with an asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm at least 4 cm in diameter. The decision aid consisted of a one-time viewing of an interactive CD-ROM elaborating on elective surgery versus watchful waiting. Generally, the decision aid advised patients with aneurysms less than 5.5 cm to agree to watchful waiting, for larger aneurysms the decision aid provided insight into the balance of benefit and harm of surgical and conservative approaches, taking into account age, co-morbidity and size of the aneurysm. The primary outcome was patient decisional conflict measured at 1 month follow-up (Decisional Conflict Scale). Secondary outcomes were patient knowledge, anxiety and satisfaction. In 178 aneurysm patients, decisional conflict scores did not differ significantly between the decision aid and the regular information groups (22 vs. 24 on the 0-100 Decisional Conflict Scale; p = .33). Patients in the decision aid group had significantly better knowledge (10.0 vs. 9.4 out of 13 points; p = .04), whereas anxiety levels (4.4 and 5.0 on a 0-21 scale; p = .73) and satisfaction scores (74 and 73 on a 0-100 scale; p = .81) were similar in both groups.",2014,Error Retrieving

"Suppression of abdominal aortic aneurysm formation by AR-R17779, an agonist for the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.","Activation of vagal nerve suppresses inflammatory responses through activation of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR). We sought to determine whether AR-R17779, a selective agonist of α7nAchR, affects the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). AAA was induced by topical application of calcium chloride (CaCl2) to abdominal aorta (AAA group). NaCl (0.9%) was substituted for CaCl2 as a sham operation (SHAM group). AR-R17779 was administered in drinking water (AAA/AR-R group). One and 6 weeks after the operation, aortic tissue was excised for histological and molecular analyses. Aortic diameter and macrophage infiltration into the aortic adventitia were increased in AAA group compared with SHAM group at 6 weeks. Treatment with AR-R17779 reduced the diameter of the aorta and macrophage infiltration compared with AAA group. Wavy morphology of the elastic lamellae was lost in AAA group while it was preserved in AAA/AR-R group. Expression of inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activities were enhanced in AAA group, which was suppressed in AAA/AR-R group.

Association between polymorphisms in the interleukin-10 gene and risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm.,"In this case-control study, we attempted to investigate the role of three common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; -1082G/A rs1800896, -819T/C rs1800871, and -592A/C rs1800872) in the IL-10 gene in the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm in a Chinese population. Three hundred and eighty-one patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm and age- and gender-matched healthy controls (N = 381) were collected between March 2012 and March 2014. The IL-10 -1082G/A, -819T/C, and -592A/C polymorphisms were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Logistic regression analyses revealed that the AA genotype of IL-10 -1082G/A was associated with an increased risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm compared to the GG genotype in a codominant model [odds ratio (OR) = 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-2.60]. Moreover, the GA+AA genotype was correlated with an elevated risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm compared to the GG genotype in a dominant model (OR = 1.34, 95%CI = 1.01-1.79). In conclusion, the results of our study suggested that the A allele of IL-10 -1082G/A is significantly associated with the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm compared to the wide-type genotype.",2015,"['Wang, F', 'Quan, Q Q', 'Zhang, C L', 'Li, Y B', 'Jiang, T B']"
The potential role of DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is characterised by the chronic degradation and gradual, irreversible dilation of the abdominal aorta. Smoking, genetics, male sex and increased age are major factors associated with developing AAA. Rupture contributes to around 2% of deaths in all Caucasians over 65, and there is no pharmaco-therapeutic treatment. Methylation is an epigenetic modification to DNA, where a methyl group is added to a cytosine base 5' to a guanine (CpG dinucleotide). Methylation patterns are long term, inherited signatures that can induce changes in gene transcription, and can be affected by both genetic and environmental factors. Methylation changes are involved in hypertension and atherosclerosis, both of which are risk factors of, and often coexist with AAA. Extra-cellular matrix degradation and inflammation, both important pathological hallmarks of AAA, are also promoted by changes in CpG methylation in other diseases. Additionally, the adverse effects of smoking and ageing take place largely through epigenetic manipulation of the genome. Every factor associated with AAA appears to be associated with DNA methylation, yet no direct evidence confirms this. Future work to identify a link between global methylation and AAA, and differentially methylated regions may reveal valuable insight. The identification of a common epigenetic switching process may also signify a promising future for AAA pharmaco-therapeutic strategies. Epigenetic therapies are being designed to target pathogenic CpG methylation changes in other diseases, and it is feasible that these therapies may also be applicable to AAA in the future.",2015,"['Toghill, Bradley J', 'Saratzis, Athanasios', 'Harrison, Seamus C', 'Verissimo, Ana R', 'Mallon, Eamonn B', 'Bown, Matthew J']"
Chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 blockade by AMD3100 inhibits experimental abdominal aortic aneurysm expansion through anti-inflammatory effects.,"Inflammation plays a critical role in the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Because stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) is known for its ability to attract inflammatory cells, we investigated whether SDF-1/chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) axis is expressed in aneurysmal aortic wall and plays a role in AAA physiopathology and asked whether its blockade modulates AAA formation and expansion. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that SDF-1α and CXCR4 mRNA levels are increased in both human and CaCl2-induced mouse AAA wall and are positively correlated to the aortic diameter in mice. ELISA quantification and immunostaining demonstrated that, in mice, aortic SDF-1α is rapidly induced during AAA formation, first by apoptotic vascular smooth muscle cells in the injured media and then by adventitial macrophages once AAA is fully established. Using green fluorescent protein-positive (GFP(+/-)) bone marrow transplantation experiments, we demonstrated that aortic SDF-1 overexpression is implicated in the recruitment of bone marrow-derived macrophages within the AAA wall. Furthermore, in mice, blockade of CXCR4 by AMD3100 decreases the infiltration of adventitial macrophages, inhibits AAA formation, and prevents aortic wall destruction. AMD3100 reduces the mRNA levels of MMP-12 and MMP-14 as well as that of inflammatory effectors MCP-1, MIP-1β, MIP-2α, RANTES, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and E-selectin. Finally, AMD3100 stabilizes the diameter of formed, expanding AAAs in 2 experimental models.",2014,"['Michineau, Stéphanie', 'Franck, Grégory', 'Wagner-Ballon, Orianne', 'Dai, Jianping', 'Allaire, Eric', 'Gervais, Marianne']"

Editor's Choice - Endovascular aneurysm repair versus open repair for patients with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm: a systematic review and meta-analysis of short-term survival.,"There is clinical equipoise between open (OR) and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for the best treatment of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (RAAA). The aim of the study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the short-term (combined 30-day or in-hospital) survival after EVAR and OR for patients with RAAA. Data sources included Medline, Embase, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry until 13 January 2014. All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), observational cohort studies, and administrative registries comparing OR and EVAR of at least 50 patients were included. Articles were full-length and in English. Standard PRISMA guidelines were followed. The methodological quality of RCTs was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias. The quality of observational studies was assessed with a modified Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies. The results of the RCTs, of the obersvational studies, and of the administrative registries were pooled separately and analysed with the use of a random effects model. From a total of 3,769 articles, three RCTs, 21 observational studies, and eight administrative registries met the inclusion criteria. In the RCTs, the risk of bias was lowest and the pooled odds ratio for death after EVAR versus OR was 0.90 (95% CI 0.65-1.24). The majority of the observational studies had a high risk of bias and the pooled odds ratio for death was 0.44 (95% CI 0.37-0.53). The majority of the administrative registries had a high risk of bias and the pooled odds ratio for death was 0.54 (95% CI 0.47-0.62).",2014,"['van Beek, S C', 'Conijn, A P', 'Koelemay, M J', 'Balm, R']"
Zoledronate attenuates angiotensin II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm through inactivation of Rho/ROCK-dependent JNK and NF-κB pathway.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening disease affecting almost 10% of the population over the age of 65. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs) have been shown to exert anti-atherogenic and anti-angiogenic effects, but the potential effects of N-BPs on AAA remain unclear. Here, we tested whether a potent N-BP, zoledronate, can attenuate the formation of Angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced AAA in hyperlipidaemic mice. Low-density lipoprotein receptor(-/-) (LDLR(-/-)) mice infused for 28 days with Ang II were treated with placebo and 100 μg/kg/day zoledronate. Continuous Ang II infusion in LDLR(-/-) mice exhibited a 59% incidence of AAA formation, and treatment with zoledronate decreased AAA formation (21%). Compared with the saline group, administration of zoledronate in Ang II-infused LDLR(-/-) mice attenuated the expansion of the suprarenal aorta (maximal aortic diameter), reduced elastin degradation in the media layer of the aorta, and significantly diminished vascular inflammation by reduction in vascular cell adhesion molecule expression and macrophage accumulation. Treatment with zoledronate decreased matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in aortic tissues. Zoledronate-treated mice had significant down-regulation of JNK, NF-κB, and reduced Ang II-induced Rho/ROCK activation. Zoledronate reduced monocytes adherence to human aortic endothelial cells in vitro.",2013,"['Tsai, Shih-Hung', 'Huang, Po-Hsun', 'Peng, Yi-Jen', 'Chang, Wei-Chou', 'Tsai, Hsiao-Ya', 'Leu, Hsin-Bang', 'Chen, Jaw-Wen', 'Lin, Shing-Jong']"
The alpha-2-antiplasmin Arg407Lys polymorphism is associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm.,"Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) involves dilatation of the abdominal aorta, with a natural history of expansion and eventual rupture. We have previously shown that AAA patients form denser clots with smaller pores, which are more resistant to fibrinolysis. The aim of this study was to use functional polymorphisms of the fibrinolytic system to identify how changes to proteins involved in fibrinolysis may play a role in the development of AAA. Caucasian subjects ≥ 55 years (602 AAA patients and 490 matched controls) were genotyped for four polymorphisms (α-2-antiplasmin α2AP Arg6Trp and Arg407Lys, Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor TAFI Thr325Ile and tissue plasminogen activator tPA 7351C→T). DNA was extracted from blood, and genotype identified using real time PCR. Fibrin clot structure was analysed by permeation and turbidity in a subset of patients and controls. Genotypes across the study population were in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. The two α2AP polymorphisms, Arg6Trp and Arg407Lys were in linkage disequilibrium (P<0.0001), and possession of a 407Lys allele negatively associated with AAA (odds ratio 0.833, CI95 0.7-0.991, P=0.040). The TAFI Thr325Ile and the tPA 7351C→T polymorphisms were not associated with AAA. The α2AP 407Lys allele was not associated with in-vitro fibrinolysis times in plasma from patients with AAA.",2014,"['Bridge, Katherine I', 'Macrae, Fraser', 'Bailey, Marc A', 'Johnson, Anne', 'Philippou, Helen', 'Scott, D Julian A', 'Ariёns, Robert A S']"
Inhibition of development of experimental abdominal aortic aneurysm by c-jun N-terminal protein kinase inhibitor combined with lysyl oxidase gene modified smooth muscle progenitor cells.,"Chronic inflammation, imbalance between the extracellular matrix synthesis and degradation, and loss of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) contribute to the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the therapy with periaortic incubation of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase inhibitor SP600125 infused from an osmotic pump and subadventitial injection of lysyl oxidase (LOX) gene modified autologous smooth muscle progenitor cells (SPCs) on treatment of AAA in a rabbit model. Obvious dilation of the abdominal aorta in the control group was caused by periaortic incubation of calcium chloride and elastase. But the progression of aortic dilation was significantly decreased after the treatment with SP600125 and LOX gene modified SPCs compared to the treatment with phosphate-buffered saline. This therapy could inhibit matrix metalloproteinases expression, enhance elastin synthesis, improve preservation of elastic laminar integrity, benefit SPCs survival and restore SMCs population. It seemed that this method might provide a novel therapeutic strategy to treat AAA.",2015,"['Chen, Feng', 'Zhang, ZhenDong', 'Zhu, XianHua']"
Prevention of abdominal aortic aneurysm by anti-microRNA-712 or anti-microRNA-205 in angiotensin II-infused mice.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is characterized as a progressive dilation and degradation of the aortic wall, associated with activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and inflammation. Emerging evidence indicates a role for microRNAs (miRNAs) in AAA pathogenesis, but it is unclear whether abdominal aortic endothelial miRNAs play a role in the disease process. We aimed to identify miRNAs in the abdominal aortic endothelium that play a critical role in AAA development. The mouse model of AAA induced by angiotensin II infusion was used in this study. Through a miRNA array and validation study, we initially identified the murine-specific miR-712 and subsequently its human/murine homolog miR-205 as angiotensin II-induced miRNAs in the abdominal aortic endothelium in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, miR-712 stimulated MMP activity in the aortic wall by directly targeting 2 MMP inhibitors: tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) and reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs (RECK). Silencing of miR-712 and miR-205 by using anti-miR-712 and anti-miR-205, respectively, significantly decreased the aortic MMP activity and inflammation, preventing AAA development in angiotensin II-infused ApoE(-/-) mice. Further, upregulation of 4 angiotensin II-sensitive miRNAs, miR-205, -21, -133b, and -378, identified in this murine study were confirmed in human AAA samples compared with nondiseased control.",2014,"['Kim, Chan Woo', 'Kumar, Sandeep', 'Son, Dong Ju', 'Jang, In-Hwan', 'Griendling, Kathy K', 'Jo, Hanjoong']"
Aromatase is required for female abdominal aortic aneurysm protection.,"The protective effects of female gender on the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) have been attributed to anti-inflammatory effects of estrogen. Estrogen synthesis is dependent on the enzyme aromatase, which is located both centrally in the ovaries and peripherally in adipose tissue, bone, and vascular smooth muscle cells. It is hypothesized that deletion of aromatase in both ovarian and peripheral tissues would diminish the protective effect of female gender and would be associated with increased aortic diameter in female mice. Male and female 8- to 10-week-old mice with aromatase (wild type: WT) and without aromatase (ArKO) underwent elastase aortic perfusion with aortic harvest 14 days following. For the contribution of central and peripheral estrogen conversion to be evaluated, female WT mice were compared with female WT and ArKO mice that had undergone ovariectomy (ovx) at 6 weeks followed by elastase perfusion at 8 to 10 weeks. At aortic harvest, maximal aortic dilation was measured and samples were collected for immunohistochemistry and protein analysis. Serum was collected for serum estradiol concentrations. Groups were compared with analysis of variance. Human and mouse AAA cross sections were analyzed with confocal immunohistochemistry for aromatase, smooth muscle markers, and macrophage markers. Female WT mice had significant reduction in aortic dilation compared with male WT mice (F WT, 51.5% ± 15.1% vs M WT, 78.7% ± 14.9%; P < .005). The protective effects of female gender were completely eliminated with deletion of aromatase (F ArKO, 82.6% ± 13.8%; P < .05 vs F WT). Ovariectomy increased aortic dilation in WT mice (F WT ovx, 70.6% ± 11.7%; P < .05 vs F WT). Aromatase deletion with ovariectomy further increased aortic dilation compared with WT ovx mice (F ArKO ovx, 87.3% ± 14.7%, P < .001 vs F WT and P < .05 vs F WT ovx). Accordingly, female ArKO ovx mice had significantly higher levels of the proinflammatory cytokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interleukin-1β and were associated with increased macrophage staining and decreased elastin staining. Regarding serum hormone levels, decreasing estradiol levels correlated with increasing aortic diameter (R = -0.565; P < .01). By confocal immunohistochemistry, both human and mouse AAA smooth muscle cells (smooth muscle α-actin positive) and macrophages (CD68 positive or Mac-2 positive) expressed aromatase.",2015,"['Johnston, William F', 'Salmon, Morgan', 'Su, Gang', 'Lu, Guanyi', 'Ailawadi, Gorav', 'Upchurch, Gilbert R']"
INFLAMMATORY ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM--A FORM OF CHRONIC PERIAORTITIS.,"Chronic periaortitis represents a unique pathogenic concept for three entities: Inflammatory Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm, Idiopathic Retroperitoneal Fibrosis and Perianeurysmal Retroperitoneal Fibrosis. The fundamental meaning of an inflammatory reaction to advanced atherosclerosis has been developed on the bottom of clinical and histological features. The triad of abdominal pain, weight loss and elevated inflammatory markers: erythrocyte sedimentation rate/C-reactive protein in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms revealed on contrast-enhanced computer tomography is highly suggestive for inflammatory aneurysm. We report a case of a heavy-smoker adult male presented with suddenly abdominal symptoms suggestive for mesenteric ischemia which have proved to be due to inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. The most favorable management of patients with inflammatory aneurysm is ambiguous. Surgical approach seems reasonable even supposing inflammatory aneurysm emerges less likely to rupture than the atherosclerotic variant. Corticosteroids are used in inoperable inflammatory aneurysm, even if is well known that this treatment does not change the long-term outcome of the disease. Surgical-open or Endovascular Repair of the aneurysm is the elective treatment.",Error Retrieving,"['Pop, Corina', 'Nemeş, Roxana Maria', 'Jantea, Petruţa', 'Tomescu, Alina', 'Postolache, Paraschiva']"
Endovascular Versus Open Repair as Primary Strategy for Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: A National Population-based Study.,"In randomized trials, no peri-operative survival benefit has been shown for endovascular (EVAR) repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) when compared with open repair. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of primary repair strategy on early and midterm survival in a non-selected population based study. The Swedish Vascular Registry was consulted to identify all rAAA repairs performed in Sweden in the period 2008-12. Centers with a primary EVAR strategy (treating > 50% of rAAA with EVAR) were compared with centers with a primary open repair strategy. Peri-operative outcome, midterm survival, and incidence of rAAA repair/100,000 inhabitants aged > 50 years were assessed. In total, 1,304 patients were identified. Three primary EVAR centers (pEVARc) operated on 236 patients (74.6% EVAR). Twenty-six primary open repair centers (pORc) operated 1,068 patients (15.6% EVAR). Patients treated at pEVARc were more often referrals (28.0% vs. 5.3%; p < .01), had a higher rate of respiratory comorbidity (36.5% vs. 21.9%; p < .01), and higher pre-operative systolic blood pressure (84.3 vs. 72.3 mmHg; p < .01). There was no difference in mortality based on primary treatment strategy at 30 days (pEVARc 28.0%, n = 66; pORc 27.4%, n = 296 [p = .87]), 1 year (pEVARc 39.9%, n = 93; pORc 34.7%, n = 366 [p = .19]), or 2 years (42.1%, n = 94; 38.3%, n = 394 [p = .28]), either overall or in subgroups based on age or referral status. Overall, patients treated with EVAR were older (mean age 76.4 vs. 74.0 years; p < .01), and had a lower 30 day mortality (EVAR 21.6%, n = 74; odds ratio 29.6%, n = 288 [p = < .01]). Incidence of rAAA repair was lower in pEVARc regions (6.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.01-7.13) when compared with pORc regions (8.15, 95% CI 7.64-8.66).",2016,"['Gunnarsson, K', 'Wanhainen, A', 'Djavani Gidlund, K', 'Björck, M', 'Mani, K']"
Outcome in Men with a Screen-detected Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Who are not Fit for Intervention.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening in Gloucestershire has been ongoing for 25 years. The aim of this study was to review the outcome of a cohort of men with a large (> 5.4 cm) screen-detected AAA who did not have early intervention for their AAA. A prospectively maintained database was interrogated for a 10-year interval from 2001 to 2011. Men who did not have their large AAA repaired within 3 months of the diagnosis were identified. The reasons for initial nonintervention and subsequent outcomes were identified from a combination of hospital case notes and general practitioner records. Of 334 men referred, 59 (median age 71 years, range 62-83 years) did not have intervention within 3 months (initial nonintervention rate 17.6%). The reasons included placed back on surveillance after assessment (n = 34); immediately discharged (n = 12); required further investigations (n = 5); died before complete assessment (n = 3); and incomplete follow-up (n = 5). Sixteen men had delayed AAA repair with no perioperative mortality. Overall mortality in the study was 14/34 (nine from ruptured AAA, the rest from medical conditions). Two further men survived repair of a ruptured AAA. The overall rate of ruptured AAA was 11/59 (18.6%).",2015,"['Lim, J', 'Wolff, J', 'Rodd, C D', 'Cooper, D G', 'Earnshaw, J J']"
Nifedipine attenuation of abdominal aortic aneurysm in hypertensive and non-hypertensive mice: Mechanisms and implications.,"Rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a lethal event. No oral medicine has been available to prevent or treat AAA. We have recently identified a novel mechanism of eNOS uncoupling by which AAA develops, in angiotensin II (Ang II) infused hyperphenylalaninemia 1 (hph-1) mice. Using this unique model we investigated effects on AAA formation of the L-type calcium channel blocker nifedipine, in view of the unclear relationship between hypertension and AAA, and unclear mechanisms of aneurysm protective effects of some blood pressure lowering drugs. Six-month old hph-1 mice were infused with Ang II (0.7 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks, and fed nifedipine chow at two different doses (5 and 20 mg/kg/day). While the high dose of nifedipine reduced blood pressure, the lower dose had no effect. Interestingly, the incidence rate of AAA dropped from 71% to 7 and 12.5% for low and high dose nifedipine, respectively. Expansion of abdominal aorta, determined by ultrasound imaging, was abolished by both doses of nifedipine, which recoupled eNOS completely to improve NO bioavailability. Both also abrogated aortic superoxide production. Of note, Ang II activation of NADPH oxidase in vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, known to uncouple eNOS, was also attenuated by nifedipine. Although low dose was a sub-pressor while the high dose reduced blood pressure via inhibition of calcium channels, both doses were highly effective in preventing AAA by preserving eNOS coupling activity to eliminate sustained oxidative stress from uncoupled eNOS. These data demonstrate that oral treatment of nifedipine is highly effective in preserving eNOS function to attenuate AAA formation. Nifedipine may be used for AAA prevention either at low dose in AAA risk group, or at high dose in patients with co-existing hypertension.",2015,"['Miao, Xiao Niu', 'Siu, Kin Lung', 'Cai, Hua']"
Ischemic acute pancreatitis with pancreatic pseudocyst in a patient with abdominal aortic aneurysm and generalized atheromatosis - case report.,"Ischemic pancreatitis is a rare medical entity. The pancreatic tissue is susceptible to ischemia with the possibility of developing acute pancreatitis. The abdominal aortic aneurysm can be one possible cause of pancreatic hypoperfusion. We report the case of a 68-year-old man, Caucasian, with a history of a cluster of severe cardiovascular conditions, who presented epigastric pain of variable intensity for about 2 weeks. The pain occurred after intense physical effort, and was associated with anorexia and asthenia. The palpation revealed epigastric pain and palpable pulsatile mass above the umbilicus. Laboratory tests showed increased serum and urine amylases. The abdominal contrast-enhanced CT scan evidenced acute lesions of the pancreas and a caudal pancreatic pseudocyst of 39x24 mm. An abdominal aortic aneurysm was also described (which extended from the kidney level to the bilateral femoral level) with a maximum diameter of 60.5 mm and generalized atheromatosis. By corroborating clinical, anamnestic, laboratory and imaging data, the case was diagnosed as moderately severe acute ischemic pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst, abdominal aortic aneurysm, generalized atheromatosis. The pancreatic pseudocyst was resorbed in eight months. Surgery for the abdominal aneurysm was performed after the resorption of the pseudocyst. The patient died after aortic surgery because of a septic complication.",2015,"['Cocota, Ileana', 'Badea, Radu', 'Scridon, Traian', 'Dumitrascu, Dan L']"
Interaction of biomechanics with extracellular matrix components in abdominal aortic aneurysm wall.,"Little is known about the interactions between extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and locally acting mechanical conditions and material macroscopic properties in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). In this study, ECM components were investigated with correlation to corresponding biomechanical properties and loads in aneurysmal arterial wall tissue. Fifty-four tissue samples from 31 AAA patients (30♂; max. diameter Dmax 5.98 ± 1.42 cm) were excised from the aneurysm sac. Samples were divided for corresponding immunohistological and mechanical analysis. Collagen I and III, total collagen, elastin, and proteoglycans were quantified by computational image analysis of histological staining. Pre-surgical CT data were used for 3D segmentation of the AAA and calculation of mechanical conditions by advanced finite element analysis. AAA wall stiffness and strength were assessed by repeated cyclical, sinusoidal and destructive tensile testing. Amounts of collagen I, III, and total collagen were increased with higher local wall stress (p = .002, .017, .030, respectively) and strain (p = .002, .012, .020, respectively). AAA wall failure tension exhibited a positive correlation with collagen I, total collagen, and proteoglycans (p = .037, .038, .022, respectively). α-Stiffness correlated with collagen I, III, and total collagen (p = .011, .038, and .008), while β-stiffness correlated only with proteoglycans (p = .028). In contrast, increased thrombus thickness was associated with decreased collagen I, III, and total collagen (p = .003, .020, .015, respectively), and AAA diameter was negatively associated with elastin (p = .006).",2015,"['Tanios, F', 'Gee, M W', 'Pelisek, J', 'Kehl, S', 'Biehler, J', 'Grabher-Meier, V', 'Wall, W A', 'Eckstein, H-H', 'Reeps, C']"
Length of abdominal aortic aneurysm and incidence of endoleaks type II after endovascular repair.,"To evaluate the predicting factors for the development of endoleak type II, its frequency and influencing factors after elective endovascular repair (EVAR) of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Data were prospectively collected in a unicenter observational study (tertiary center of [endo-] vascular surgery) and retrospectively evaluated in patients who had undergone elective EVAR of AAA. Vascular (lumbar arteries (LA) and inferior mesenteric artery, aneurysm) and general patient (habits, medication, basic diseases) as well as procedural characteristics, were analyzed for their association with the development of endoleak type II. Pre and postinterventional computed tomography (CT) scans were evaluated for aneurysm anatomy, in particular, postinterventional growth or shrinkage as well detection of an endoleak of each type. The study cohort included 82 patients (mean age, 72 (52-87) years; 77 men, 93.9%) throughout 36 months. The median follow-up period was 29.5 months (range, 1-57). Overall, 51 endoleaks type II (62.2%) were identified at any time during the postinterventional follow-up period. In the Cox regression, AAA length was the only significant predictor (P = 0.024; hazard ratio (HR), 1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-1.14). Thirteen patients (15.8%) underwent at least one secondary intervention. Aneurysm growth was observed in four patients because of an endoleak type II (4.9%).

Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Factors Influencing Survival Following Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair.,"Predicting long-term survival following repair is essential to clinical decision making when offering abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) treatment. A systematic review and a meta-analysis of pre-operative non-modifiable prognostic risk factors influencing patient survival following elective open AAA repair (OAR) and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was performed. MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane electronic databases were searched to identify all relevant articles reporting risk factors influencing long-term survival (≥1 year) following OAR and EVAR, published up to April 2015. Studies with <100 patients and those involving primarily ruptured AAA, complex repairs (supra celiac/renal clamp), and high risk patients were excluded. Primary risk factors were increasing age, sex, American Society of Anaesthesiologist (ASA) score, and comorbidities such as ischaemic heart disease (IHD), cardiac failure, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), renal impairment, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and diabetes. Estimated risks were expressed as hazard ratio (HR). A total of 5,749 study titles/abstracts were retrieved and 304 studies were thought to be relevant. The systematic review included 51 articles and the meta-analysis 45. End stage renal disease and COPD requiring supplementary oxygen had the worst long-term survival, HR 3.15 (95% CI 2.45-4.04) and HR 3.05 (95% CI 1.93-4.80) respectively. An increase in age was associated with HR of 1.05 (95% CI 1.04-1.06) for every one year increase and females had a worse survival than men HR 1.15 (95% CI 1.07-1.27).

[What is the evidence to support screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm and what is the role of the primary care physicians ?].,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm is a serious and potentially fatal vascular disease. Surgical intervention is typically reserved for aneurysms 55 mm in diameter or greater. Randomized trials addressing the efficacy of ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm have shown that screening reduced aneurysm-related mortality in men but not in women who have a lower prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Screening with ultrasonography is recommended in men 65 to 75 years of age with a history of smoking and is suggested in women in this age group if they have risk factors such as smoking and hypertension. Men and women with a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm should undergo screening as well. Persons who have a stable aneurysm should undergo regular surveillance or operative intervention depending on aneurysm size. Primary care physicians have to play a key role before prescribing screening in assessing risks and benefits of repair in each patient. For persons with an aneurysm of less than 55 mm in diameter, the primary care physicians should provide information and interventions for the prevention of cardiovascular disease such as screening for and treating hypertension and interventions for tobacco cessation for smokers. The family physicians should also ensure that radiological monitoring of aneurysms is complete.",2015,"['Motte', 'S']"

Plasma Low-density Lipoprotein Receptor-related Protein 1 Concentration is not Associated with Human Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Presence.,"Recent genetic data suggest that a polymorphism of LRP1 is an independent risk factor for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The aims of this study were to assess whether plasma and aortic concentrations of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) are associated with AAA, and to investigate the possible relevance of LRP1 to AAA pathophysiology. Three analyses were conducted. First, plasma LRP1 concentrations were measured in community-dwelling men with and without AAA (n = 189 and n = 309, respectively) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Second, Western blotting analyses were employed to compare the expression of LRP1 protein in aortic biopsies collected from patients with AAA and nonaneurysmal postmortem donors (n = 6/group). Finally, the effect of in vitro LRP1 blockade on matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9) clearance by vascular smooth muscle cells was assessed by zymography. Plasma LRP1 concentrations did not differ between groups of men with and without AAA (median concentration 4.56 μg/mL [interquartile range {IQR} (3.39-5.96)] and 4.43 μg/mL [IQR 3.44-5.84], respectively; p = .48), and were not associated with AAA after adjusting for other risk factors (odds ratio 1.10 [95% confidence interval: 0.91-1.32]; p = 0.35). In contrast, LRP1 expression was approximately 3.4-fold lower in aortic biopsies recovered from patients with AAA compared with controls (median [IQR] expression 1.72 [0.94-3.14] and 5.91 [4.63-6.94] relative density units, respectively; p < .01). In vitro LRP1 blockade significantly reduced the ability of vascular smooth muscle cells to internalize extracellular MMP9.",2015,"['Moxon, J V', 'Behl-Gilhotra, R', 'Morton, S K', 'Krishna, S M', 'Seto, S W', 'Biros, E', 'Nataatmadja, M', 'West, M', 'Walker, P J', 'Norman, P E', 'Golledge, J']"
Macrophage inflammasome mediates hyperhomocysteinemia-aggravated abdominal aortic aneurysm.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a serious vascular disease with high mortality. Our previous study suggested that hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) exaggerates the occurrence of AAA. Here, we investigated whether macrophage inflammasome is involved in HHcy-aggravated AAA formation. Two independent HHcy-aggravated AAA models, perivascular calcium phosphate-treated C57BL/6 mice and angiotensin II (Ang II)-infused apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice were used. NLPR3, caspase 1, and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels were higher in aneurysmal lesions of both HHcy models compared to controls, preferentially in macrophages. Similarly, macrophage inflammasome activation was observed in vitro. Folic acid administration reversed the HHcy-accelerated AAA, with ameliorated activation of inflammasome in the tunica adventitia. Lentiviral silencing of NLRP3 significantly ameliorated HHcy-aggravated AAA formation. We observed increased mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and energy switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis with excess Hcy in macrophages. Blocking mitochondrial ROS production in macrophages abolished inflammasome activation. Our study highlights the potential importance of macrophage inflammasome in the pathogenesis and development of HHcy-aggravated AAA.",2015,"['Sun, Weiliang', 'Pang, Yanli', 'Liu, Ziyi', 'Sun, Lulu', 'Liu, Bo', 'Xu, Mingjiang', 'Dong, Yongqiang', 'Feng, Juan', 'Jiang, Changtao', 'Kong, Wei', 'Wang, Xian']"
CT signal heterogeneity of abdominal aortic aneurysm as a possible predictive biomarker for expansion.,"There is a need for prognostic biomarkers for risk assessment of small abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Since CT textural analysis of tissue is a recognized feature of adverse biology and patient outcome in other diseases, we investigated it as a possible biomarker in small AAA. Fifty consecutive patients (46-men, 4-woman, median-age 75 y, range 56-85) with small AAA (3-5.5 cm) under surveillance undergoing serial ultrasound were prospectively recruited and assessed at baseline with CT texture analysis (CTTA) and 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET). We followed forty patients (36-men, 4-woman, median-age=74 y, range 60-85, participation rate=80% for 1 year. For each axial image, CTTA using the filtration-histogram technique was carried out using a software algorithm that selectively extracts texture features of different coarseness (fine, medium and coarse) and intensity variation. Standard-deviation (SD) and kurtosis (K) at each feature-scale were measured. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 18F-FDG in each axial image of the AAA was also measured with corrections for blood pool 18F-FDG activity to assess AAA metabolic activity. Specificity, sensitivity, and c-statistics were calculated with 95% confidence intervals for prediction of significant AAA expansion (≥2 mm) by CTTA measures before and after adjusting for clinical variables. The median aneurysm expansion at 12 months was 2.0 mm, (IQR 0.0-4.0). Coarse texture SD correlated inversely with AAA SUVmax (rs=-0.456, P=0.003).

Segmental aortic stiffening contributes to experimental abdominal aortic aneurysm development.,"Stiffening of the aortic wall is a phenomenon consistently observed in age and in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). However, its role in AAA pathophysiology is largely undefined. Using an established murine elastase-induced AAA model, we demonstrate that segmental aortic stiffening precedes aneurysm growth. Finite-element analysis reveals that early stiffening of the aneurysm-prone aortic segment leads to axial (longitudinal) wall stress generated by cyclic (systolic) tethering of adjacent, more compliant wall segments. Interventional stiffening of AAA-adjacent aortic segments (via external application of surgical adhesive) significantly reduces aneurysm growth. These changes correlate with the reduced segmental stiffness of the AAA-prone aorta (attributable to equalized stiffness in adjacent segments), reduced axial wall stress, decreased production of reactive oxygen species, attenuated elastin breakdown, and decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines and macrophage infiltration, and attenuated apoptosis within the aortic wall, as well. Cyclic pressurization of segmentally stiffened aortic segments ex vivo increases the expression of genes related to inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling. Finally, human ultrasound studies reveal that aging, a significant AAA risk factor, is accompanied by segmental infrarenal aortic stiffening.",2015,"['Raaz, Uwe', 'Zöllner, Alexander M', 'Schellinger, Isabel N', 'Toh, Ryuji', 'Nakagami, Futoshi', 'Brandt, Moritz', 'Emrich, Fabian C', 'Kayama, Yosuke', 'Eken, Suzanne', 'Adam, Matti', 'Maegdefessel, Lars', 'Hertel, Thomas', 'Deng, Alicia', 'Jagger, Ann', 'Buerke, Michael', 'Dalman, Ronald L', 'Spin, Joshua M', 'Kuhl, Ellen', 'Tsao, Philip S']"
Matricellular protein CCN3 mitigates abdominal aortic aneurysm.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality; however, the mechanisms that are involved in disease initiation and progression are incompletely understood. Extracellular matrix proteins play an integral role in modulating vascular homeostasis in health and disease. Here, we determined that the expression of the matricellular protein CCN3 is strongly reduced in rodent AAA models, including angiotensin II-induced AAA and elastase perfusion-stimulated AAA. CCN3 levels were also reduced in human AAA biopsies compared with those in controls. In murine models of induced AAA, germline deletion of Ccn3 resulted in severe phenotypes characterized by elastin fragmentation, vessel dilation, vascular inflammation, dissection, heightened ROS generation, and smooth muscle cell loss. Conversely, overexpression of CCN3 mitigated both elastase- and angiotensin II-induced AAA formation in mice. BM transplantation experiments suggested that the AAA phenotype of CCN3-deficient mice is intrinsic to the vasculature, as AAA was not exacerbated in WT animals that received CCN3-deficient BM and WT BM did not reduce AAA severity in CCN3-deficient mice. Genetic and pharmacological approaches implicated the ERK1/2 pathway as a critical regulator of CCN3-dependent AAA development. Together, these results demonstrate that CCN3 is a nodal regulator in AAA biology and identify CCN3 as a potential therapeutic target for vascular disease.",2016,"['Zhang, Chao', 'van der Voort, Dustin', 'Shi, Hong', 'Zhang, Rongli', 'Qing, Yulan', 'Hiraoka, Shuichi', 'Takemoto, Minoru', 'Yokote, Koutaro', 'Moxon, Joseph V', 'Norman, Paul', 'Rittié, Laure', 'Kuivaniemi, Helena', 'Atkins, G Brandon', 'Gerson, Stanton L', 'Shi, Guo-Ping', 'Golledge, Jonathan', 'Dong, Nianguo', 'Perbal, Bernard', 'Prosdocimo, Domenick A', 'Lin, Zhiyong']"
Changes in temperature affect the risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture.,"There is a well-established link between exposure to hot and cold temperatures and an increased risk of cardiovascular hospitalization or death. There is also contrasting evidence of a seasonal increase in aortic ruptures related to atmospheric pressure, but an association with environmental temperature has never been formally modelled. Using a prospective database, we identified 295 patients who were operated in a single centre for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in south-east Queensland between 1990 and 2010. We matched patients to their nearest weather station to estimate their exposure to temperature and air pressure in the days leading up to their rupture. We used the case-crossover method to estimate the risks of temperature, which we allowed to be non-linear (increased risks at high and low temperatures) and delayed by up to 25 days. There was an immediate increase in risk after exposure to cold, and a delayed risk after exposure to heat. An increased risk after exposure to high pressures disappeared after adjusting for temperature. At a mean temperature of 19°C (66°F), the odds ratio for rupture was 1.73 (95% confidence interval: 1.09, 2.76) compared with the reference temperature of 24°C.",2014,"['Brightwell, Robert E', 'Choong, Andrew M T L', 'Barnett, Adrian G', 'Walker, Philip J']"
Mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysm after adjuvant therapy with bacillus Calmette-Guérin in patients with urothelial bladder cancer: a rare but misinterpreted complication.,"Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) therapy is often associated with side effects. The most feared is disseminated sepsis that may occur rarely with the development of mycotic aortic aneurysms. Twenty cases of patients treated with intravesical BCG complicated by mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysm have been reported in the literature, including 2 cases of the present study. Delayed vascular work-up represents a critical aspect. Mycotic aneurysms evidence a rapid progression. Primary care physicians and urologists should be sensitized to recognize unspecified symptoms such as potential clinical manifestations of a mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysm, even several months or years after BCG therapy.",2015,"['Leo, Enrico', 'Molinari, Alessandro L C', 'Rossi, Giovanni', 'Ferrari, Stefano A', 'Terzi, Angelo', 'Lorenzi, Giovanni']"
Extra-anatomic endovascular repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm with a horseshoe kidney supplied by the aneurysmal aorta.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm complicated by a horseshoe kidney (HSK, fused kidney) represents a unique challenge for repair. Renal arteries arising from the aneurysmal aorta can further complicate intervention. Reports exist describing the repair of these complex anatomies using fenestrated endografts, hybrid open repairs (debranching), and open aneurysmorrhaphy with preservation of renal circulation. We describe an extra-anatomic, fully endovascular repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm with a HSK partially supplied by a renal artery arising from the aneurysm. We successfully applied aortouni-iliac endografting, femorofemoral bypass, and retrograde renal artery perfusion via the contralateral femoral artery to exclude the abdominal aortic aneurysm and preserve circulation to the HSK.",2015,"['Rey, Jorge', 'Golpanian, Samuel', 'Yang, Jane K', 'Moreno, Enrique', 'Velazquez, Omaida C', 'Goldstein, Lee J', 'Chahwala, Veer']"
Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm during transthoracic echocardiography in patients with significant coronary artery disease.,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) shares several risk factors with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). We evaluated the prevalence during transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and risk factors of AAA in patients with CAD. A total of 1300 CAD patients were screened from August 2009 to May 2010, and measurement of abdominal aorta size was feasible in 920 patients (71%) at the end of routine TTE. An AAA was defined as having a maximal diameter of ≥30 mm. Of the 920 patients, 22 (2.4% of the study population) were diagnosed with AAA; of these AAA patients, 86% were male, and 82% were over 65 years-old. Abdominal aortic size was weakly correlated with aortic root diameter (r=0.22, p<0.01). Although the proportions of male gender, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were higher in AAA patients, such differences were not statistically significant. Advanced age [odds ratio (OR)=1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.12; p<0.01], smoking (OR=3.44; 95% CI: 1.18-10.04; p=0.02), and peripheral arterial disease (OR=5.88; 95% CI: 1.38-25.05; p=0.01) were found to be associated with AAA.",2015,"['Lee, Sung Ho', 'Chang, Sung-A', 'Jang, Shin Yi', 'Lee, Sang-Chol', 'Song, Young Bin', 'Park, Seung Woo', 'Choi, Seung-Hyuk', 'Gwon, Hyeon-Cheol', 'Oh, Jae K', 'Kim, Duk-Kyung']"
Incidence and Outcomes of Severe Renal Impairment Following Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) following ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) repair is common and multifactorial. A standard definition of AKI after endovascular repair (EVAR), the Aneurysm Renal Injury Score (ARISe), has been proposed to facilitate standardised reporting and thus improve understanding of this issue. Data were collected retrospectively on AKI in a prospectively maintained database of all patients treated for rAAA in a single tertiary referral centre since the availability of routine out of hours emergency EVAR. The ARISe score was used to describe the degree of AKI and factors which correlated with poor renal outcomes were assessed. Two-hundred and five patients were treated between January 2006 and April 2014. Of these, 125 were treated with open repair (OSR) and 80 were treated with EVAR. Severe AKI (defined as ARISe score ≥3) occurred in 36% of patients. After correction for confounders, patients treated with OSR were significantly more likely to develop severe AKI (43% vs. 26%, p = .02). There was no significant difference in preoperative serum creatinine between groups, but increased preoperative serum creatinine was strongly associated with severe AKI postoperatively (p < .001). Age, sex, endograft type, and preoperative CT scanning were not associated with differences in renal outcomes. Clamp position above renal arteries was predictive of severe AKI in patients treated with OSR (p < .01). Patients suffering severe AKI had significantly higher mortality at 30 days and 12 months (28% vs. 5% and 44% vs. 13%, p < .001 for both comparisons).",2015,"['Ambler, G K', 'Coughlin, P A', 'Hayes, P D', 'Varty, K', 'Gohel, M S', 'Boyle, J R']"
On-label use of commercially-available abdominal endografts for para-anastomotic aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms after infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm open repair.,"To analyze feasibility and outcomes of endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) with a strictly on-label use of abdominal aortic endografts (OnL-EVAR) to treat para-anastomotic aneurysms (PAAs) and pseudoaneurysms (PSAs) after infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm open repair (OR). The data of all consecutive patients treated between 1999 and 2012 for non-infected abdominal PAAs and PSAs at our center were prospectively collected. All cases fit for EVAR based on the instructions for use of a series of abdominal aortic endografts commercially available during the study period were scheduled for OnL-EVAR regardless of patients' surgical risk. Any patients unfit for OnL-EVAR underwent OR or other complex endovascular techniques. One hundred and forty-three patients were collected; 78 underwent OR and 65 endovascular repair with different strategies. Coil embolization, hybrid, and chimney/periscope grafts techniques were limited to seven patients unfit both for OR and OnL-EVAR. Inclusion criteria for OnL-EVAR were reached in 58 patients for an overall OnL-EVAR feasibility of approximately 40% (21% for PAAs and 55% for PSAs). In particular, OnL-EVAR feasibility was 19% in case of involvement of proximal aortic anastomosis, 71% for distal aortic anastomosis, and 80% for iliac arteries. Overall, 25 aortouniiliac and 11 bifurcated implants were performed, single proximal aortic cuffs were used in 10 patients, and iliac extension in 12. Primary technical success was 98% without perioperative mortality. At a median follow-up of 67 months (range: 1-144 months), cumulative aneurysm-related mortality was 7%, endograft migration 7%, and reintervention was 17%. Life-table analysis showed actuarial survival and freedom from aneurysm-related death at 1, 3, and 5 years of 100%, 98%, and 95%, and of 100%, 98%, and 95%, respectively. Freedom from aortic reintervention or open conversion at 1, 3, and 5 years was 94%, 90%, and 85%.",2013,"['Tshomba, Y', 'Mascia, D', 'Kahlberg, A', 'Marone, E M', 'Melissano, G', 'Chiesa, R']"

Regional Differences in Case Mix and Peri-operative Outcome After Elective Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair in the Vascunet Database.,"National differences exist in the outcome of elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. The role of case mix variation was assessed based on an international vascular registry collaboration. All elective AAA repairs with aneurysm size data in the Vascunet database in the period 2005-09 were included. AAA size and peri-operative outcome (crude and age adjusted mortality) were analysed overall and in risk cohorts, as well as per country. Glasgow Aneurysm Score (GAS) was calculated as risk score, and patients were stratified in three equal sized risk cohorts based on GAS. Predictors of peri-operative mortality were analysed with multiple regression. Missing data were handled with multiple imputation. Patients from Australia, Finland, Hungary, Norway, Sweden and the UK (n = 5,895) were analysed; mean age was 72.7 years and 54% had endovascular repair (EVAR). There were significant variations in GAS (lowest = Finland [75.7], highest = UK [79.4], p for comparison of all regions < .001), proportion of AAA < 5.5 cm (lowest = UK [6.4%], highest = Hungary [29.0%]; p < .001), proportion undergoing EVAR (lowest = Finland [10.1%], highest = Australia [58.9%]; p < .001), crude mortality (lowest = Norway [2.0%], highest = Finland [5.0%]; p = .006), and age adjusted mortality (lowest = Norway [2.5%], highest = Finland [6.0%]; p = .048). Both aneurysm size and peri-operative mortality were highest among patients with a GAS >82. Of those with a GAS >82, 8.4% of men and 20.8% of women had an AAA <5.5 cm.",2015,"['Mani, K', 'Venermo, M', 'Beiles, B', 'Menyhei, G', 'Altreuther, M', 'Loftus, I', 'Björck, M']"
"Abdominal aortic aneurysm, arterial stiffening and the role of the intraluminal thrombus.","Measure of arterial stiffness could be affected by the presence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and especially an intraluminal thrombus (ILT). We, therefore, sought to study this possible connection by measuring pulse wave velocity (PWV) and pulse wave analysis (PWA) including augmentation index adjusted to heart rate 75 (Aix75) in patients with AAA ± ILT. PWV and PWA were measured in male patients with AAA from an ongoing Danish AAA screening trial. Information on blood pressure, medications, BMI and smoking status was obtained at inclusion. In total, 157 patients were included. Mean age was 73 years. Mean AAA size was 42.2 mm. Fifty-six of the patients had an intraluminal thrombus, and patients with AAA and ILT had a significantly higher Aix75 than patients with AAA but without ILT (Mean = 28.3 ± 1.4 SEM vs. 24.9 ± 0.81, p=0.027), a difference that was also significant when adjusting for AAA size, blood pressure and age.

Risk factors associated with late aneurysmal sac expansion after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.,"We aimed to identify the risk factors associated with late aneurysmal sac expansion after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). We retrospectively reviewed contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images of 143 patients who were followed for ≥6 months after EVAR. Sac expansion was defined as an increase in sac diameter of 5 mm relative to the preoperative diameter. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify associated risk factors for late sac expansion after EVAR from the following variables: age, gender, device, endoleak, antiplatelet therapy, internal iliac artery embolization, and preprocedural variables (aneurysm diameter, proximal neck diameter, proximal neck length, suprarenal neck angulation, and infrarenal neck angulation). Univariate analysis revealed female gender, endoleak, aneurysm diameter ≥60 mm, suprarenal neck angulation >45°, and infrarenal neck angulation >60° as factors associated with sac expansion. Multivariate analysis revealed endoleak, aneurysm diameter ≥60 mm, and infrarenal neck angulation >60° as independent predictors of sac expansion (P < 0.05, for all).",Error Retrieving,"['Nakai, Motoki', 'Ikoma, Akira', 'Sato, Hirotatsu', 'Sato, Morio', 'Nishimura, Yoshiharu', 'Okamura, Yoshitaka']"
Open versus endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm: Incidence of cardiovascular events in 632 patients in a department of defense cohort over 6-year follow-up.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is common with unacceptably high rates of mortality and morbidity with unknown rates of complications after repair in the Department of Defense (DoD). All patients treated at a DOD or VA clinic or medical facility with a diagnosis of AAA identified by ICD-9 code search were identified by Patient Administration Systems and Biostatistics Activity (PASBA) using the Standard Inpatient Data Record (SIDR) and Composite Ambulatory Patient Encounter Record (CAPER) from January 2006 till December 2011. The primary outcome was death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and cardiac arrhythmia between subjects who underwent endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) or open aortic repair (OAR). A total of 8314 patients were screened to identify 632 patients who underwent surgical repair of non-ruptured AAA. EVAR was performed in 497 patients (78.6%) and OAR in 135 patients (21.4%). Mortality at 30 days was less common in EVAR patients (1.6% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.004), but was not sustained (16.9% vs. 17.8%, p = 0.797). Mean survival free from mortality was not different between the two groups (EVAR vs. OAR: 6.14 ± 0.13 years vs. 6.11 ± 0.22 years, p = 0.378). The composite endpoint of MI, stroke, arrhythmia, or death was not different between groups at 30 days (EVAR vs. OAR: 12.9% vs. 14.1%, p = 0.774) or in long-term follow-up population (EVAR vs. OAR: 40.6% vs. 31.9%, p = 0.073) though there was a trend toward higher event rates in the EVAR.

Murine abdominal aortic aneurysm model by orthotopic allograft transplantation of elastase-treated abdominal aorta.,"Murine models have proved instrumental in studying various aspects of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), from identification of underlying pathophysiologic changes to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. In the current study, we describe a new model in which an elastase-treated donor aorta is transplanted to a recipient mouse and allowed to progress to aneurysm. We hypothesized that by transplanting an elastase-treated abdominal aorta of one genotype to a recipient mouse of a different genotype, one can differentiate pathophysiologic factors that are intrinsic to the aortic wall from those stemming from circulation and other organs. Elastase-treated aorta was transplanted to the infrarenal abdominal aorta of recipient mice by end-to-side microsurgical anastomosis. Heat-inactivated elastase-treated aorta was used as a control. Syngeneic transplants were performed with use of 12-week-old C57BL/6 littermates. Transplant grafts were harvested from recipient mice on day 7 or day 14 after surgery. The aneurysm outcome was measured by aortic expansion, elastin degradation, proinflammatory cytokine expression, and inflammatory cell infiltration and compared with that produced with the established, conventional elastase infusion model. The surgical technique success rate was 75.6%, and the 14-day survival rate was 51.1%. By day 14 after surgery, all of the elastase-treated transplanted abdominal aortas had dilated and progressed to AAAs, defined as 100% or more increase in the maximal external diameter compared with that measured before elastase perfusion, whereas none of the transplanted aortas pretreated with inactive elastase became aneurysmal (percentage increase in maximum aortic diameter: 159.36% ± 23.27%, transplanted elastase, vs 41.46% ± 9.34%, transplanted inactive elastase). Aneurysm parameters, including elastin degradation and infiltration of macrophages and T lymphocytes, were found to be identical to those observed in the conventional elastase model. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed similarly increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines (relative changes of mRNA in the conventional elastase model vs transplant model: tumor necrosis factor α, 1.71 ± 0.27 vs 2.93 ± 0.86; monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, 2.36 ± 0.58 vs 2.87 ± 0.51; chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5, 3.37 ± 0.92 vs 3.46 ± 0.83; and interferon γ, 3.09 ± 0.83 vs 5.30 ± 1.69).

Controlled release of ascorbic acid from gelatin hydrogel attenuates abdominal aortic aneurysm formation in rat experimental abdominal aortic aneurysm model.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory response. We investigated the hypothesis that the known antioxidant ascorbic acid, which can also promote elastin and collagen production by smooth muscle cells, would prevent AAA formation in a rat model. An intraluminal elastase and extraluminal calcium chloride-induced rat AAA model was used, and the animals were divided into three groups: control (group C, n = 18), the aorta wrapped with a saline-impregnated gelatin hydrogel sheet (group G, n = 18), and the aorta wrapped with a gelatin hydrogel sheet incorporating ascorbic acid (group A, n = 18). Wrapping of the sheet was completed at the end of treatment for AAA creation. The aortic dilatation ratio was measured, and aortic tissues were further examined for oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage using biochemical and histologic techniques. Aortic dilatation at both 4 and 8 weeks was inhibited in group A (dilatation ratio [%] at 4 weeks: 186.2 ± 21.8 in group C, 152.3 ± 10.2 in group G, 126.8 ± 11.6 in group A; P < .0001; dilatation ratio [%] at 8 weeks: 219.3 ± 37.5 in group C, 194.0 ± 11.6 in group G, 145.7 ± 8.3 in group A; P = .0002). Elastin and collagen content were significantly preserved in group A (elastin, P = .0015; collagen, P < .0001). The messenger RNA expressions of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, interleukin-1β, and tissue necrosis factor-α (P = .0024, P < .0001, P < .0001, and P < .0001, respectively) were downregulated in group A (P = .0024), whereas tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 were both upregulated in group A (TIMP-1, P = .0014; TIMP-2, P < .0001). Gelatin zymography showed activities of pro-MMP-2, MMP-2, and MMP-9 were significantly suppressed in group C (P < .0001 for each). Reactive oxygen species expression and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and cluster of differentiation 68 staining were significantly suppressed in group A (reactive oxygen species expression, P < .0001; 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine-positive cells, P < .0001; cluster of differentiation 68 positive cells, P < .0001).",2014,"['Tanaka, Akiko', 'Hasegawa, Tomomi', 'Morimoto, Keisuke', 'Bao, Wulan', 'Yu, Jie', 'Okita, Yutaka', 'Tabata, Yasuhiko', 'Okada, Kenji']"
Impact of gender and body surface area on outcome after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.,"A gender-neutral threshold aneurysm diameter (AD) of more than 5.5 cm for surgical intervention in abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) ignores the fact that women have a smaller baseline AD. We hypothesized that women have a greater AD relative to body surface area (BSA) at the time of surgery and that this worsens outcome. The Vascular Study Group of New England database was queried for elective AAA repairs performed from 2003 to 2011 to compare BSA-indexed AD, ie, aortic size index (ASI), between men and women at the time of surgery and the impact of ASI on outcome. Women were older and had higher ASI among both open-repair (n = 1,566) and endovascular repair (n = 2,172) patients (P < .001). Among open-repair patients, mean ASI for men undergoing repair at AD of 5.5 cm (2.75 cm/m²) was used to subdivide women into 2 categories: women with ASI of 2.75 or more were older (P < .001), had a larger aneurysm size (P < .001), and had a higher 1-year mortality (P = .042) than women with ASI less than 2.75.",2015,"['Matyal, Robina', 'Shakil, Omair', 'Hess, Philip E', 'Lo, Ruby', 'Jainandunsing, Jayant S', 'Mahmood, Bilal', 'Hartman, Greg S', 'Schermerhorn, Marc L', 'Mahmood, Feroze']"
Infra-renal abdominal aortic calcification volume does not predict small abdominal aortic aneurysm growth.,"Vascular calcification is a common finding in abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) however whether it predicts aneurysm expansion is controversial. 1) To establish a reproducible method of assessing AAA calcification using computed tomography (CT); 2) To investigate the association between AAA calcification and growth. Patients were identified from a prospectively maintained small AAA surveillance database. To be included patients required at least two CT scans a minimum of 6 months apart. All patients had a maximal AAA diameter of ≤55 mm on their initial scan. Infra-renal aortic calcification volume, total infra-renal aortic volume and maximal AAA diameter were measured. Reproducibility was assessed from repeat scans performed on 31 patients. AAA growth, estimated by volume change per year, was compared between patients with baseline infra-renal aortic calcification volumes< and ≥median. 95% agreement limits (lower, upper) for intra and inter-observer error in measuring infra-renal aortic calcification volume were 0.68, 97 mm(3) and -140, 5.8 mm(3), respectively. Concordance correlation coefficients for inter and intra-observer variability in measuring infra-renal aortic calcification volume were 0.99 and 0.99, respectively. Patients with infra-renal aortic calcification volume < median (n = 44) and ≥median (n = 44) had an infra-renal aortic volume increase of 6.0 cm(3)/yr and 7.8 cm(3)/yr, respectively (p = 0.66). Mean percentage infra-renal aortic volume increase/yr was found to be 4.2 ± 6.4 and 8.9 ± 6.2 for patients with and without diabetes, respectively (p = 0.003).",2015,"['Hendy, Kerolos', 'Gunnarsson, Ronny', 'Cronin, Oliver', 'Golledge, Jonathan']"
Risk factors and outcomes of postoperative ischemic colitis in contemporary open and endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.,"Postoperative ischemic colitis (IC) can be a serious complication following infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. We sought to identify risk factors and outcomes in patients developing IC after open AAA repair and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was used to examine clinical data of patients undergoing AAA repair from 2011 to 2012 who developed postoperative IC. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors and outcomes. We evaluated a cohort of 3486 patients who underwent AAA repair (11.6% open repair and 88.4% EVAR). The incidence of postoperative IC was 2.2% (5.2% for open repair and 1.8% for EVAR). Surgical treatment was needed in 49.3% of patients who developed IC. The mortality of patients with IC was higher than that of patients without IC (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 4.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.26-7.92; P < .01). The need for surgical treatment (AOR, 7.77; 95% CI, 2.08-28.98; P < .01) and age (AOR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01-1.22; P = .01) were mortality predictors of IC patients. Predictive factors of IC included need for intraoperative or postoperative transfusion (AOR, 6; 95% CI, 3.08-11.72; P < .01), rupture of the aneurysm before surgery (AOR, 4.07; 95% CI, 1.78-9.31; P < .01), renal failure requiring dialysis (AOR, 3.86; 95% CI, 1.18-12.62; P = .02), proximal extension of the aneurysm (AOR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.04-4.59; P = .03), diabetes (AOR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.01-3.46; P = .04), and female gender (AOR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.01-3.02; P = .04). Although open AAA repair had three times higher rate of postoperative IC compared with endovascular repair, in multivariate analysis we did not find any statistically significant difference between open repair and EVAR in the development of IC (5.2% vs 1.8%; AOR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.70-2.25; P = .43).",2016,"['Moghadamyeghaneh, Zhobin', 'Sgroi, Michael D', 'Chen, Samuel L', 'Kabutey, Nii-Kabu', 'Stamos, Michael J', 'Fujitani, Roy M']"
Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm with severely angulated neck and tortuous artery access: case report and literature review.,"Endovascular aneurysm repair has revolutionized the therapeutic strategy for abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, hostile proximal aneurysmal neck and tortuosity of access vessels remain challenges in selecting optimal stent-grafts in abdominal aortic aneurysms with difficult anatomy. A 65-year-old woman complained of intermittent abdominal pain for one week. Computed tomography angiogram demonstrated a tortuous infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with a tapered neck and a 136° of infrarenal angulation. Aneurysmal dilatation and severe calcification of bilateral iliac arteries and tortuous aortoiliac access were also showed. Endovascular approach using Endurant stent-graft was attempted at an outside hospital, but failed because of the significant tortuosity of the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries. Since the patient refused to have open aneurysm repair, he was transferred to our hospital for further evaluation and possible EVAR with a different approach. EVAR was performed successfully using Gore Excluder stent-grafts (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA). During the procedure, cannulation of the contralateral limb was unable to be achieved because of the tortuous aortoiliac course. Therefore, a snare was inserted from right radial artery, through the contralateral gate, to grasp the wire from left femoral artery. Two iliac stent-grafts were sequentially deployed with the lower end distal to the opening of the left internal iliac artery. Angiography confirmed complete sealing of the aneurysm with patency of bilateral renal arteries and external iliac arteries. The postoperative courses were uneventful and follow-up computed tomography angiogram at 6 months demonstrated patent bilateral femoral and renal arteries without endoleaks or stent migration.",2015,"['Zeng, Qinglong', 'Huang, Lianjun', 'Huang, Xiaoyong', 'Peng, Mingliang']"
Orally administered dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (alogliptin) prevents abdominal aortic aneurysm formation through an antioxidant effect in rats.,"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, a novel antidiabetic drug, has a cardioprotective effect on ischemia-reperfusion injury through an antioxidant effect. However, the effect of DPP-4 inhibitor on aneurysm formation has not been investigated. We aimed to test the hypothesis that the DPP-4 inhibitor, alogliptin, attenuates vascular oxidative stress and thus inhibits abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation. AAAs were created with intraluminal elastase and extraluminal calcium chloride in 36 male rats. Rats were divided into three groups: a low dose of alogliptin group (group LD; 1 mg/kg/d), a high-dose group (group HD; 3 mg/kg/d), and a control group (group C, water). Alogliptin was administered by gastric gavage once daily beginning 3 days before surgery. On day 7 after aneurysm preparation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) expression was semiquantified by dihydroethidium staining, and the oxidation product of DNA produced by ROS, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), was measured by immunohistochemical staining. Blood glucose concentrations were measured. Hematoxylin and eosin and elastica Van Gieson stainings were performed on day 28, and the AAA dilatation ratio was calculated. On day 7 (six in each group), dihydroethidium staining of the aneurysm wall showed a reduced level of ROS expression (4.6 ± 0.6 in group C, 2.7 ± 0.3 in group LD, and 1.7 ± 0.5 in group HD; P < .0001) and showed fewer 8-OHdG-positive cells in alogliptin-treated samples (138.1 ± 7.4 cells in group C, 102.5 ± 4.5 cells in group LD, and 66.1 ± 4.5 cells in group HD; P < .0001) The treatment significantly reduced messenger RNA expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in aneurysm walls (relative expression: MMP-2: 2.1 ± 0.4 in group C, 1.3 ± 0.3 in group LD, and 0.9 ± 0.2 in group HD; P < .001; MMP-9: 2.0 ± 0.5 in group C, 0.3 ± 0.3 in group LD, and 0.3 ± 0.2 in group HD; P < .001). On day 28 (six in each group), the aortic wall in groups LD and HD was less dilated (dilatation ratio: 199.2% ± 11.8% in group C, 159.6% ± 2.8% in group LD, and 147.1% ± 1.9% in group HD; P < .02 group C vs HD) and had higher elastin content than in group C.

Metabolic syndrome is associated with type II endoleak after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.,"Type II endoleak is usually a benign finding after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). In some patients, however, type II endoleak leads to aneurysm sac expansion and the need for further intervention. We examined which factors, in particular the components of metabolic syndrome (MetS), would lead to an increase risk of endoleak after EVAR. The medical records of all patients who underwent EVAR between 2002 and 2011 at the Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System were reviewed. MetS was defined as the presence of three or more of the following: hypertension (blood pressure ≥130 mm Hg/≥90 mm Hg), serum triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL, serum high-density lipoproteins ≤50 mg/dL for women and ≤40 mg/dL for men, body mass index ≥30 kg/m(2), and fasting blood glucose ≥110 mg/dL. Development of endoleak, including specific endoleak type, was determined by review of standard radiologic surveillance. During a 9-year period, 79 male patients (mean age, 73.5 years), underwent EVAR for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (mean 6.2 cm maximal transverse diameter). MetS was present in 52 patients (66%). The distribution of MetS factors among all patients was hypertension in 86%, hypertriglyceridemia in 72%, decreased high-density lipoprotein in 68%, diabetes in 37%, and a body mass index of ≥30 kg/m(2) in 30%. No survival difference was found between the MetS and non-MetS groups (P = .66). There was no difference in perioperative myocardial infarction or visceral ischemia immediately postoperatively between the two groups. Patients with MetS had a significant increase in acute kidney injury (n = 7, P = .0128). Endoleaks of all types were detected in 26% (n = 20) of all patients; patients with MetS had more endoleaks than patients without MetS (35% vs 7.4%, P = .0039). Of the 19 type II endoleaks, 79% were present at the time of EVAR and only 21% developed during surveillance; 95% had MetS (P = .0007).",2014,"['Hall, Michael R', 'Protack, Clinton D', 'Assi, Roland', 'Williams, Willis T', 'Wong, Daniel J', 'Lu, Daniel', 'Muhs, Bart E', 'Dardik, Alan']"

Rare disease. Coronary artery disease is common in elderly patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. Here we report a case of the combination of surgical repair for abdominal aortic aneurysm and off-pump and minimally invasive coronary artery bypass surgery. A 74-year-old man who presented at our clinic with chest pain was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His medical history included right coronary artery stenting. Physical examination revealed a pulsatile abdominal mass on the left side and palpable peripheral pulses. Computed tomography scans showed an infrarenal abdominal aneurysm with a 61-mm enlargement. Coronary angiography revealed 80% stenosis in the stent within the right coronary artery and 20% stenosis in the left main coronary artery. The patient underwent elective coronary artery bypass grafting and abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.

How does elective laparoscopic abdominal aortic aneurysm repair compare to endovascular aneurysm repair?,"A best evidence topic in surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was how elective laparoscopic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair compared to endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in terms of survival. There were 229 papers found using the reported search, with 8 papers (5 prospective studies, 1 retrospective study, 1 randomized trial and 1 systematic review) representing the best evidence to answer the question proposed. Current evidence suggests that EVAR is the preferred surgical approach for AAA repair, due to shorter hospital stay and lower perioperative morbidity and mortality rates, as opposed to an open surgical approach. Despite this, EVAR is subject to a number of limitations, including device restrictions in patients with anatomical variations as well as increased risk of future complications stemming from device implantation. We discuss a key study that showed that complications in the EVAR group commonly included endoleak type II and graft thrombosis. More importantly, there were similar rates of complications between those patients receiving EVAR and those receiving minimally invasive aortic surgery. The evidence suggests that elective laparoscopic AAA repair has a favourable safety profile comparable with that of EVAR, with low conversion rates as well as similar mortality and morbidity rates. This has been illustrated in several studies. We discuss a prospective randomized trial of 100 patients, which compared EVAR with hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery. This study showed no deaths in either group after the procedure or at follow-up after 12 months, with similar complication rates between the groups. While the evidence suggests that EVAR is less invasive, it does not always significantly alter the postoperative course or length of hospital stay for patients. We conclude from the evidence available that elective laparoscopic AAA repair may have a role in those patients who are unsuitable for EVAR. Unfortunately, few studies exist directly comparing these two techniques, and those that do are subject to limitations, for example, study population bias, small sample sizes and a lack of comparison in the literature between the common AAA repair techniques.",2014,"['Ahmed, Nadeem', 'Gollop, Nicholas D', 'Ellis, Jonathan', 'Khan, Omar A']"
"Psychological distress and risk of peripheral vascular disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and heart failure: pooling of sixteen cohort studies.","Examine the little-tested relation of psychological distress with peripheral vascular disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and heart failure. Pooling of raw data from 166,631 male and female participants in 16 UK-based cohort studies. Psychological distress was measured using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. Peripheral vascular disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and heart failure events were based on death register linkage. During a mean follow-up 9.5 years there were 17,368 deaths of which 8625 were cardiovascular disease-related. Relative to the asymptomatic group (0 score), the highly distressed group (score 7-12) experienced an elevated risk of peripheral vascular disease (adjusted hazard ratio; 95% confidence interval: 3.39; 1.97, 5.82) and heart failure (1.76; 1.37, 2.26).

Delayed closure technique using the ventral hernia repair prosthesis for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm: report of a case.,"In spite of modern advances in medical care, the operative mortality of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm remains high at 40%-50%. Multiple organ failure is one of the reasons for the high mortality rates. An acute increase in intra-abdominal pressure and abdominal compartment syndrome are common causes of multiple organ failure.It is important to prevent abdominal compartment syndrome to improve the outcome of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. Delayed abdominal closure is effective in preventing abdominal compartment syndrome in patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. We successfully achieved delayed abdominal closure using the ventral hernia repair prosthesis for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, in a straightforward and rapid manner. No infection was seen, secondary closure was readily performed, and wound healing was good. We conclude that our delayed closure technique is useful for the treatment of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.",2014,"['Hisatomi, Kazuki', 'Yamada, Takafumi', 'Onohara, Daisuke']"
Imaging vessel wall biology to predict outcome in abdominal aortic aneurysm.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture risk is currently determined based on size and symptoms. This approach does not address the rupture risk associated with small aneurysms. Given the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in AAA weakening and rupture, we investigated the potential of MMP-targeted imaging for detection of aneurysm biology and prediction of outcome in a mouse model of AAA with spontaneous rupture. Fifteen-week-old mice (n=66) were infused with angiotensin II for 4 weeks to induce AAA. Saline-infused mice (n=16) served as control. The surviving animals underwent in vivo MMP-targeted micro-single photon emission computed tomographic/computed tomographic imaging, using RP805, a technetium-99m-labeled MMP-specific tracer, followed by ex vivo planar imaging, morphometry, and gene expression analysis. RP805 uptake in suprarenal aorta on micro-single photon emission computed tomographic images was significantly higher in animals with AAA when compared with angiotensin II-infused animals without AAA or control animals. CD68 expression and MMP activity were increased in AAA, and significant correlations were noted between RP805 uptake and CD68 expression or MMP activity but not aortic diameter. A group of angiotensin II-infused animals (n=24) were imaged at 1 week and were followed up for additional 3 weeks. RP805 uptake in suprarenal aorta at 1 week was significantly higher in mice that later developed rupture or AAA. Furthermore, tracer uptake at 1 week correlated with aortic diameter at 4 weeks.",2015,"['Golestani, Reza', 'Razavian, Mahmoud', 'Nie, Lei', 'Zhang, Jiasheng', 'Jung, Jae-Joon', 'Ye, Yunpeng', 'de Roo, Michelle', 'Hilgerink, Koen', 'Liu, Chi', 'Robinson, Simon P', 'Sadeghi, Mehran M']"
"Preadmission use of renin-angiotensin blockers and rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysm: a nationwide, population-based study.","Rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAA) is associated with high mortality. Use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has been suggested to reduce the risk of rAAA. This nationwide, combined case-control and follow-up study aims to examine the possible impact of preadmission renin-angiotensin system blockade on the risk of rAAA and case fatality following rAAA. Using Danish healthcare registries, a combined case-control and follow-up study was conducted among all patients with a first-time hospital admission for rAAA and AAA controls without rupture in Denmark from 1996 to 2012. Individual-level data were obtained on preadmission drug use, comorbidity, socioeconomic factors, healthcare services use, and death. The adjusted age-matched and sex-matched odds ratios (adj. OR) were 0.96 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.85; 1.07) for rAAA for current ACE-inhibitor users and 0.93 (95%CI: 0.79; 1.09) for current ARB users compared with never users.

"Hyperhomocysteinaemia, low folate concentrations and MTHFR C677T mutation in abdominal aortic aneurysm.","Homocysteine (Hcy) has been implicated in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). However, the association of Hcy, vitamin B12, and folate in patients with AAA has not been studied in China. This study was conducted with the aim to evaluate the relationship of vitamin B12, folic acid, and Hcy levels in AAA. 463 patients who had AAA were included in this study. 463 control subjects were age- and sex-matched with the patients.

Differential gene expression in human abdominal aortic aneurysm and aortic occlusive disease.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and aortic occlusive disease (AOD) represent common causes of morbidity and mortality in elderly populations which were previously believed to have common aetiologies. The aim of this study was to assess the gene expression in human AAA and AOD. We performed microarrays using aortic specimen obtained from 20 patients with small AAAs (≤ 55mm), 29 patients with large AAAs (> 55mm), 9 AOD patients, and 10 control aortic specimens obtained from organ donors. Some differentially expressed genes were validated by quantitative-PCR (qRT-PCR)/immunohistochemistry. We identified 840 and 1,014 differentially expressed genes in small and large AAAs, respectively. Immune-related pathways including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and T-cell-receptor signalling were upregulated in both small and large AAAs. Examples of validated genes included CTLA4 (2.01-fold upregulated in small AAA, P = 0.002), NKTR (2.37-and 2.66-fold upregulated in small and large AAA with P = 0.041 and P = 0.015, respectively), and CD8A (2.57-fold upregulated in large AAA, P = 0.004). 1,765 differentially expressed genes were identified in AOD. Pathways upregulated in AOD included metabolic and oxidative phosphorylation categories. The UCP2 gene was downregulated in AOD (3.73-fold downregulated, validated P = 0.017).

Glasgow aneurysm score in predicting outcome after ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.,"To assess the ability of Glasgow Aneurysm Score in predicting postoperative mortality for ruptured aortic aneurysm which may assist in decision making regarding the open surgical repair of an individual patient. A total of 121 patients diagnosed of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm who underwent open surgery in our hospital between 1999 and 2013 were included. The Glasgow Aneurysm Score for each patient was graded according to the Glasgow Aneurysm Score (Glasgow Aneurysm Score = age in years + 17 for shock + 7 for myocardial disease + 10 for cerebrovascular disease + 14 for renal disease). The groups were divided as Group 1 (containing the patients who died) and Group 2 (the patients who were discharged). The Glasgow Aneurysm Scores amongst the groups were compared. Out of 121 patients, 108 (89.3%) were males and 13 (10.7%) were females. The in-hospital mortality was 48 patients (39.7%). The Glasgow Aneurysm Score was 84.15 ± 15.94 in Group 1 and 75.14 ± 14.67 in Group 2 which revealed significance (p = 0.002).

Potential of mesenchymal stem cell in stabilization of abdominal aortic aneurysm sac.,"In their origin, abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are related to an inflammatory reaction within the aortic wall, which can lead to weakness and degeneration of this structure. One of the most widely accepted treatment modalities for AAAs is the placement of stent grafts. Nevertheless, in some patients blood re-enters the aneurysm sac, creating so-called leaks, which constitute a renewed risk of rupture and death.This study explores the possibility of filling aneurysm sacs treated by endovascular aneurysm repair with adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) in a porcine model. We developed a porcine model using 22 animals by creating an artificial AAA made with a Dacron patch. AAAs were then treated with a coated stent that isolated the aneurysm sac, after which we introduced allogeneic ASC into the sac. Animals were followed-up for up to 3 mo. The experiment consisted of the aforementioned surgical procedure performed first, followed by computed tomography and echo-Doppler imaging during the follow-up, and finally, after sacrificing the animals, histologic analysis of tissue samples from the site of cell implantation by a blinded observer and the detection of implanted cells by immunofluorescence detection of the Y chromosome. Our findings demonstrate the survival of ASCs over the 3 mo after implantation and histologic changes associated with this treatment. Treated animals had less acute and chronic inflammation throughout the study period, and we observed increasing fibrosis of the aneurysm sac, no accumulation of calcium, and a regeneration of elastic fibers in the artery.",2015,"['Riera del Moral, L', 'Largo, C', 'Ramirez, J R', 'Vega Clemente, L', 'Fernández Heredero, A', 'Riera de Cubas, L', 'Garcia-Olmo, D', 'Garcia-Arranz, M']"
Clinical and radiological outcome after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair: comparison of different grafts. preliminary single-center experience.,"Endovascular repair (EVAR) represents a useful and validated alternative to conventional surgery in selected patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) because it is associated with a significantly lower long-term AAA-related mortality. Data regarding a series of 91 patients (88 men, 3 women, median age 71 years, range 65-82 years) is reported. The patients were divided into three groups, according to the type of implanted stent (Endurant, Excluder and Talent). High American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System (ASA) was important in increasing the likelihood of an early complication (p=0.0007), while it did not have any effect on later adverse events, which were more closely related to the size of the aneurysm (p=0.006). As expected, the aneurysm diameter influenced the endoleak incidence (p=0.011), aneurysmal sac expansion (p=0.029), re-intervention risk (p=0.031) and the success of treatment (p=0.006). A significantly lower tendency for the development of endoleak (p=0.035) and other late complications (p=0.048) was observed in patients with Endurant device. This group seems to be more likely destined to achieve therapeutic success, but the difference was not significant. A borderline significance (p=0.071) with regard to early complications was also recorded. However, the use of this type of device did not affect survival, which was exclusively related to ASA (p=0.040). No other statistically significant differences were found between groups. Since open surgery for elective suprarenal AAA repair is still associated with considerable mortality, EVAR may offer several advantages over open repair surgery, including a less invasive operative procedure, and shortened intensive care unit and hospital stay. The technological improvements of the prosthesis for EVAR will likely reduce complications related to this technique in the near future.",Error Retrieving,"['Garbo, Greta', 'Motta, Raffaella', 'Bianchera, Giorgio', 'Zini, Oscar', 'Spigolon, Luca', 'Zanon, Antonio', 'Lumachi, Franco']"
Quality assessment of elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair from referral to surgery.,"The risk of rupture for a large (≥ 55 mm) abdominal aortic aneurysm(AAA) is significant and therefore operative treatment should take place before possible aneurysm rupture. Timing of elective AAA surgery has rarely been investigated previously. The aim of this study is to evaluate success in the elective treatment process of large AAAs from referral to surgery in Helsinki University Central Hospital. We retrospectively analyzed all 361 patients who were assigned for elective treatment of AAA during 2005 - 2010. We divided the patients into subgroups according to size of the aneurysm: <60 mm, 61 - 70 mm and >70 mm. The main focus was set on the preoperative period and on potential factors causing delay. End points indicating failure in the treatment process were aneurysm ruptures and deaths before surgery. The median time from referral to surgery for the three subgroups was 112, 91 and 45 days respectively (p < 0,001). There were no significant differences between the treatment methods: open repair (OR) with 103 days and endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) with 113 days until surgery. Twenty three (6.4 %) patients were operated on emergency basis while waiting for the operation, six of them for ruptured aneurysm. There were an additional five patients with aneurysm ruptures who all died, as did four out the six operated ones.",2015,"['Noronen, Katariina', 'Laukontaus, Sani', 'Kantonen, Ilkka', 'Aho, Pekka', 'Albäck, Anders', 'Venermo, Maarit']"
Novel experimental model of enlarging abdominal aortic aneurysm in rabbits.,"This study tested the hypothesis that an experimental model of abdominal aortic aneurysm in rabbits results in progressive enlargement when induced by a combination of periaortic elastase administration and aortic coarctation. Male New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into four groups: (A) stenosis (n = 12), (B) elastase (n = 12), (C) aneurysm (n = 15), and (D) control (n = 12). The stenosis group received an extrinsic coarctation below the right renal artery, the elastase group received a 10-minute administration of 60 μL elastase (1 U/μL) in a 1.5-cm aortic segment, the aneurysm group received stenosis and elastase, and a sham operation was performed in the control group. The aortic diameter was measured after 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks, and animals were subsequently euthanized for histopathologic and immunohistochemical studies. All animals in the aneurysm group developed aneurysm by 2 weeks after treatment, with average diameters of 5.21 ± 0.74 mm by 2 weeks, 6.23 ± 1.10 mm by 4 weeks, 7.87 ± 0.50 mm by 8 weeks, and 9.40 ± 0.36 mm by 16 weeks. Aortic diameter dilated progressively, and all aneurysms developed by 4 weeks in the stenosis group (4.17 ± 0.22 mm). Only one aneurysm was seen in the elastase group by week 1 (3.60 ± 0.64 mm), and no aneurysm formed in the control group by week 8 (2.47 ± 0.38 mm). The aneurysm group exhibited less media thickness, elastin content, and endothelial recovery, but stronger expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 and rabbit macrophage compared with the control group.",2015,"['Bi, Yonghua', 'Zhong, Hongshan', 'Xu, Ke', 'Qi, Xun', 'Zhang, Zhen', 'Wu, Gang', 'Han, Xinwei']"
The effect of aortic morphology on peri-operative mortality of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.,"To investigate whether aneurysm shape and extent, which indicate whether a patient with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) is eligible for endovascular repair (EVAR), influence the outcome of both EVAR and open surgical repair. The influence of six morphological parameters (maximum aortic diameter, aneurysm neck diameter, length and conicality, proximal neck angle, and maximum common iliac diameter) on mortality and reinterventions within 30 days was investigated in rAAA patients randomized before morphological assessment in the Immediate Management of the Patient with Rupture: Open Versus Endovascular strategies (IMPROVE) trial. Patients with a proven diagnosis of rAAA, who underwent repair and had their admission computerized tomography scan submitted to the core laboratory, were included. Among 458 patients (364 men, mean age 76 years), who had either EVAR (n = 177) or open repair (n = 281) started, there were 155 deaths and 88 re-interventions within 30 days of randomization analysed according to a pre-specified plan. The mean maximum aortic diameter was 8.6 cm. There were no substantial correlations between the six morphological variables. Aneurysm neck length was shorter in those undergoing open repair (vs. EVAR). Aneurysm neck length (mean 23.3, SD 16.1 mm) was inversely associated with mortality for open repair and overall: adjusted OR 0.72 (95% CI 0.57, 0.92) for each 16 mm (SD) increase in length. There were no convincing associations of morphological parameters with reinterventions. Short aneurysm necks adversely influence mortality after open repair of rAAA and preclude conventional EVAR. This may help explain why observational studies, but not randomized trials, have shown an early survival benefit for EVAR.",2015,Error Retrieving
Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in 65-year-old men remains cost-effective with contemporary epidemiology and management.,"The epidemiology and management of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) has changed significantly, with lower prevalence, increased longevity of patients, increased use of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), and improved outcome. The clinical and health economic effectiveness of one-time screening of 65-year-old men was assessed within this context. One-time ultrasound screening of 65-year-old men (invited) versus no screening (control) was analysed in a Markov model. Data on the natural course of AAA (risk of repair and rupture) was based on randomised controlled trials. Screening detected AAA prevalence (1.7%), surgical management (50% EVAR), repair outcome, costs, and long-term survival were based on contemporary population-based data. Incremental cost-efficiency ratios (ICER), absolute and relative risk reduction for death from AAA (ARR, RRR), numbers needed to screen (NNS), and life-years gained were calculated. Annual discounting was 3.5%. In base case at 13-years follow-up the ICER was €14,706 per incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY); ARR was 15.1 per 10,000 invited, NNS was 530, and QALYs gained were 56.5 per 10,000 invited. RRR was 42% (from 0.36% in control to 0.21% in invited). In a lifetime analysis the ICER of screening decreased to €7,570/QALY. The parameters with highest impact on the cost-efficiency of screening in the sensitivity analysis were the prevalence of AAA (threshold value <0.5%) and degree of incidental detection in the control cohort.",2014,"['Svensjö, S', 'Mani, K', 'Björck, M', 'Lundkvist, J', 'Wanhainen, A']"
