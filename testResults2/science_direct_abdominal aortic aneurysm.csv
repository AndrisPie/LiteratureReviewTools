Differential expression of sex hormone receptors in abdominal aortic aneurysms,"AbstractObjectiveMale sex is a significant risk factor for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Female sex hormones have been reported to prevent aneurysm formation in animal models. The study aims to describe the expression profile of sex hormone receptors in the aneurysm wall of men and women with AAA and compare with unaffected controls.MethodsAneurysm wall biopsies were obtained during elective open repair of AAA in men and women (n=16+16). Aortic vessel wall from controls were obtained at organ donation (n=6). Western blot-, mRNA expression- and immunohistochemical analyses were performed to assess the expression profile of the sex hormone receptors – androgen receptor (AR), progesterone receptor (PR), estrogen receptor α (ERα) and β (ERβ).ResultsThe mRNA- and protein expression levels of AR were higher in AAA compared with control aorta (7.26 vs. 5.14, P=0.001). mRNA- and protein expression levels of ERβ were lower in AAA compared with control aorta (9.15 vs. 12.29, P&lt;0.001). mRNA expression levels of PR were higher in AAA compared with control aorta (8.73 vs. 6.21, P=0.003), but could not be confirmed on protein level. The expression profile of sex hormone receptors in men and women with AAA was similar.ConclusionExpression of sex hormone receptors differs in the aneurysmal aorta compared with unaffected aorta in men and women. A higher expression of AR and a lower expression of ERβ suggest that sex hormone activity could be associated with aneurysm development.",February 2017,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Christina', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Villard'}, {'given-name': 'Per', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Eriksson'}, {'given-name': 'Malin', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kronqvist'}, {'given-name': 'Mariette', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Lengquist'}, {'given-name': 'Carl', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Jorns'}, {'given-name': 'Johan', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Hartman'}, {'given-name': 'Joy', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Roy'}, {'given-name': 'Rebecka', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Hultgren'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378512216303371,1-s2.0-S0378512216303371
The beneficial place for the treatment of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms,"AbstractObjectiveTo study the beneficial place for the treatment of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAAs).MethodA retrospective chart review of consecutive RAAA patients was performed. Patients were divided into two groups: direct group and transfer group. We retrospectively reviewed patients' hospital charts and recorded various clinical factors apparent on presentation. The primary consequence was mortality during hospitalization, and some other parameters such as duration of intensive care unit (ICU). All patients were followed up at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and one year after discharge.ResultsDuring 4-year period, 56 RAAA patients were treated (24 in direct group, and 32 in transfer group). Significant differences were shown for systolic blood pressure, pulse oxygen saturation, hemoglobin, the time interval from diagnosis to operation et al. There was no difference concerning age and comorbidity among two groups. All the patients were treated by open surgical aneurysm repair. The mortality rate was 68.8% ((6 + 16)/32) in transfer group and 33.3% (8/24) in direct group (P = 0.00067). Both the duration of ICU stay and entire hospitalization were a bit longer in the transfer group, but there was no significant difference. The mean follow-up time was 25.2 ± 12.9 months. The cumulative survival difference was significant (P = 0.042) between the two groups.ConclusionIt is beneficial that we treat RAAAs in the diagnosed hospital. The reasons are: 1) to avoid the development of unstable state of aneurysm after rupturing of stable state; 2) the time interval from initial symptoms to operation will be shortened.",December 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Jiehua', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Qiu'}, {'given-name': 'Weimin', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Zhou'}, {'given-name': 'Wei', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Zhou'}, {'given-name': 'Xinhua', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Tang'}, {'given-name': 'Qingwen', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Yuan'}, {'given-name': 'Jixin', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Xiong'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1743919116309839,1-s2.0-S1743919116309839

A computational assessment of the hemodynamic effects of crossed and non-crossed bifurcated stent-graft devices for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms,"AbstractThere are several issues attributed with abdominal aortic aneurysm endovascular repair. The positioning of bifurcated stent-grafts (SG) may affect SG hemodynamics. The hemodynamics and geometrical parameters of crossing or non-crossing graft limbs have not being totally accessed. Eight patient-specific SG devices and four pre-operative cases were computationally simulated, assessing the hemodynamic and geometrical effects for crossed (n= 4) and non-crossed (n= 4) configurations. SGs eliminated the occurrence of significant recirculations within the sac prior treatment. Dean's number predicted secondary flow locations with the greatest recirculations occurring at the outlets especially during the deceleration phase. Peak drag force varied from 3.9 to 8.7N, with greatest contribution occurring along the axial and anterior/posterior directions. Average resultant drag force was 20% smaller for the crossed configurations. Maximum drag force orientation varied from 1.4° to 51°. Drag force angle varied from 1° to 5° during one cardiac cycle. 44% to 62% of the resultant force acted along the proximal centerline where SG migration is most likely to occur. The clinician's decision for SG positioning may be a critical parameter, and should be considered prior to surgery. All crossed SG devices had an increased spiral flow effect along the distal legs with reductions in drag forces.",December 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Florian', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Stefanov'}, {'given-name': 'Tim', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'McGloughlin'}, {'given-name': 'Liam', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Morris'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1350453316302119,1-s2.0-S1350453316302119

Tauroursodeoxycholic Acid Attenuates Angiotensin II Induced Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Formation in Apolipoprotein E-deficient Mice by Inhibiting Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress,"Objective/BackgroundAbdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is characterised by the infiltration of smooth muscle cell (SMC) apoptosis, inflammatory cells, neovascularisation, and degradation of the extracellular matrix. Previous work has shown that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and SMC apoptosis were increased both in a mouse model and human thoracic aortic aneurysm. However, whether the ER stress is activated in AAA formation and whether suppressing ER stress attenuates AAA is unknown.MethodsHuman AAA and control aorta samples were collected. Expression of ER stress chaperones glucose-regulated protein (GRP)-78 and GRP-94 was detected by immunohistochemical staining. The effect of ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) on AAA formation in angiotensin (Ang) II induced apolipoprotein E−/− mice was explored. Elastin staining was used to observe the rupture of elastic fragmentation. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were performed, to detect the protein expression of ER stress chaperones and apoptosis molecules.ResultsThere was significant upregulation of GRP-78 and GRP-94 in aneurysmal areas of human AAA and Ang II induced ApoE−/− mice (p &lt; .05). TUDCA significantly attenuated the maximum diameters of abdominal aortas in Ang II induced ApoE−/− mice (p &lt; .05). TUDCA significantly reduced expression of ER stress chaperones and the apoptotic cell numbers (p &lt; .05). Furthermore, TUDCA significantly reduced expression of apoptosis molecules, such as caspase-3, caspase-12, C/EBP homologous protein, c-Jun N-terminal kinase activating transcription factor 4, X-box binding protein, and eukaryotic initiation factor 2α in Ang II induced ApoE−/− mice (p &lt; .05).ConclusionThe results suggest that ER stress is involved in human and Ang II induced AAA formation in ApoE−/− mice. TUDCA attenuates Ang II induced AAA formation in ApoE−/− mice by inhibiting ER stress mediated apoptosis.",Available online 24 November 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Y.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Qin'}, {'given-name': 'Y.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Wang'}, {'given-name': 'O.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Liu'}, {'given-name': 'L.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Jia'}, {'given-name': 'W.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Fang'}, {'given-name': 'J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Du'}, {'given-name': 'Y.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Wei'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078588416305627,1-s2.0-S1078588416305627

NOX Isoforms in the Development of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,"AbstractOxidative stress plays an important role in the formation of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and we have recently established a causal role of uncoupled eNOS in this severe human disease. We have also shown that activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX) lies upstream of uncoupled eNOS. Therefore, identification of the specific NOX isoforms that are required for eNOS uncoupling and AAA formation would ultimately lead to novel therapies for AAA. In the present study, we used the Ang II infused hph-1 mice to examine the roles of NOX isoforms in the development of AAA. We generated double mutants of hph-1-NOX1, hph-1-NOX2, hph-1-p47phox, and hph-1-NOX4. After two weeks of Ang II infusion, the incidence rate of AAA substantially dropped from 76.5% in Ang II infused hph-1 mice (n=34) to 11.1%, 15.0%, 9.5% and 0% in hph-1-NOX1 (n=27), hph-1-NOX2 (n=40), hph-1-p47phox (n=21), and hph-1-NOX4 (n=33) double mutant mice, respectively. The size of abdominal aortas of the four double mutant mice, determined by ultrasound analyses, was significantly smaller than the hph-1 mice. Aortic nitric oxide and H4B bioavailabilities were markedly improved in the double mutants, while superoxide production and eNOS uncoupling activity were substantially diminished. These effects seemed attributed to an endothelial specific restoration of dihydrofolate reductase expression and activity, deficiency of which has been shown to induce eNOS uncoupling and AAA formation in both Ang II-infused hph-1 and apoE null animals. In addition, over-expression of human NOX4 N129S or T555S mutant newly identified in aneurysm patients increased hydrogen peroxide production, further implicating a relationship between NOX and human aneurysm. Taken together, these data indicate that NOX isoforms 1, 2 or 4 lies upstream of dihydrofolate reductase deficiency and eNOS uncoupling to induce AAA formation. These findings may promote development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of the disease by inhibiting NOX signaling.",Available online 19 November 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Kin Lung', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Siu'}, {'given-name': 'Qiang', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Li'}, {'given-name': 'Yixuan', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Zhang'}, {'given-name': 'Jun', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Guo'}, {'given-name': 'Ji Youn', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Youn'}, {'given-name': 'Du', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Jie'}, {'given-name': 'Hua', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Cai'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213231716302658,1-s2.0-S2213231716302658
Patients with Small Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm are at Significant Risk of Cardiovascular Events and this Risk is not Addressed Sufficiently,"BackgroundPatients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) are at significant risk of cardiovascular (CV) events. Recent implementation of AAA-screening means thousands of patients are now diagnosed with small-AAA; however, CV risk factors are not always addressed. This study aimed at assessing and quantifying the CV characteristics of patients with small AAA following the introduction of screening programmes.MethodsCV profiles of 384 men with a small AAA (&lt;55 mm diameter) were assessed through the United Kingdom Aneurysm Growth Study (UKAGS), a nationwide prospective cohort study of men with small AAA. A prospective local cohort of an additional 142 patients with small AAA with available blood pressure (BP) and lipid profiles was also included and followed-up for 1 year.ResultsIn the UKAGS population, 54% were current and 30% ex-smokers; 58% were hypertensive and 54% hypercholesterolaemic. In the local group, 54% were current and 40% were ex-smokers, and 94% were hypertensive. Patients were not more likely to receive CV medication after entering AAA surveillance in either group. All local patients were clustered “high-risk” for future CV events based on the Framingham score (mean 21.8%, 95% CI 20.0–23.6), JBS-2 (16.3%, 14.7–17.9) and ASSIGN (25.2%, 22.7–27.7). No change was seen in systolic BP levels between baseline and 1 year (140.9 mmHg vs. 142.5 mmHg, p=.435). A rise was seen in cholesterol (4.0 mmol–4.2 mmol, p&lt;.0001) values at 1 year.ConclusionsThis study suggests that patients with small AAA are at significant risk for developing CV events and this is not currently addressed, which is evident by the “high-risk” CV risk profiles of these patients despite being in AAA surveillance. Design and implementation of a CV risk reduction programme tailored for this population is necessary.",Available online 22 November 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'M.F.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bath'}, {'given-name': 'A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Saratzis'}, {'given-name': 'M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Saedon'}, {'given-name': 'D.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sidloff'}, {'given-name': 'R.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sayers'}, {'given-name': 'M.J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bown'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078588416305470,1-s2.0-S1078588416305470

Although it is routinely measured on 2D-ultrasound images, using a volumetric approach is expected to improve measurement reproducibility. In this work, 3D-ultrasound or Computed Tomography imaging of patients with AAA was combined with a minimally interactive 3D segmentation based on implicit template deformation. Segmentation usability and reproducibility was evaluated on 81 patients, showing a mean measurement time of [2;8]min per case, and Dice coefficients of 0.87±0.12 for 3D-US and 0.81±0.08 for CT. Quantification parameters included a diameter measurement from 3D-US and CT volumes with respective confidence intervals of 0.51[−2.5;3.52]mm and 1.00[−1.68;3.67]mm.

Procedure Volume and the Association with Short-term Mortality Following Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair in European Populations: A Systematic Review,"ObjectiveTo evaluate the relationship between the volume of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) procedures undertaken and the primary outcome of mortality in Europe. Previous systematic reviews of this relationship are outdated and are overwhelmingly based on US data.Data sourcesComprehensive searching within MEDLINE and other bibliographic databases supplemented by citation searching and hand-searching of journals was undertaken to identify studies that reported the effect of hospital or clinician volume on any reported outcomes in adult, European populations, undergoing AAA repair and published in the last 10 years.MethodsTwo reviewers conducted study selection with independent, duplicate data extraction and quality assessment. A planned meta-analysis was not conducted because of the high risk of bias, the likelihood of individual study subjects being included in more than one study and diversity in the clinical populations studied and methods used.ResultsSixteen studies (n = 237,074 participants) from the UK (n = 11 studies), Germany (n = 3 studies), Norway (n = 1 study), and one from the UK and Sweden were included. Data in the included studies came from administrative databases and clinical registries incorporating a variety of clinical and procedural groups; the study quality was limited by the use of observational study designs. Overall, the evidence favoured the existence of an inverse volume outcome relationship between hospital volume and mortality. Insufficient evidence was available to reach conclusions on the relationship between clinician volume and outcome and between hospital or clinician volume and secondary outcomes including complications and length of hospital stay.ConclusionsThe evidence from this review suggests a relationship between the hospital volume of AAA procedures conducted and short-term mortality; however, as volume typically represents a complex amalgamation of factors further research will be useful to identify the core characteristics of volume that influence improved outcomes.",Available online 14 November 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'P.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Phillips'}, {'given-name': 'E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Poku'}, {'given-name': 'M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Essat'}, {'given-name': 'H.B.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Woods'}, {'given-name': 'E.A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Goka'}, {'given-name': 'E.C.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kaltenthaler'}, {'given-name': 'S.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Walters'}, {'given-name': 'P.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Shackley'}, {'given-name': 'J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Michaels'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078588416305366,1-s2.0-S1078588416305366
Impact of Preoperative Pulmonary Function on Outcomes After Open Repair of Descending and Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysms,"AbstractObjectiveTo evaluate the impact of preoperative pulmonary function on outcomes following open repair of descending thoracic (DTA) and thoracoabdominal aortic (TAAA) aneurysms.MethodsThe outcomes of patients undergoing open repair of DTA or TAAA were analyzed in relation to the results of preoperative pulmonary function tests (PFT). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was adopted to assess the effect of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) on the incidence of mortality. Logistic regression analysis and propensity score matching (PSM) were used.ResultsBetween 1997 and 2015, 726 patients underwent open DTA or TAAA repair. PFT were available in 711 (97.9%). ROC analysis revealed the cutoff value of FEV1 to be 50%. PSM led to 149 pairs of patients with FEV1 below and above 50% with only limited residual imbalance. In the matched population operative mortality was 11.4% and 6.0% in patients with FEV1≤50% and FEV1≥51% respectively (p=0.10). The incidence of major adverse events was 33.1% in cases with FEV1≤50% and 19.5% in those with FEV1≥51% (p=0.008). FEV1≤50% was associated with a 6.99x increase in the risk of major postoperative adverse events at logistic regression analysis.ConclusionsPreoperative FEV1 &lt; 50% is strongly predictive of increased respiratory failure, tracheostomy and operative mortality in patients undergoing open DTA/TAAA repair.

Endovascular repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms using fenestrated and branched endografts,"AbstractPurposeThe study purpose was to review the outcomes of patients treated for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms using endovascular repair with fenestrated and branched stent-grafts in a single center.MethodsWe reviewed the clinical data of the first 185 consecutive patients (134 male; mean age, 75 ± 7 years) treated for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms using fenestrated and branched stent-grafts. Graft design evolved from physician-modified endografts (2007-2013) to off-the-shelf or patient-specific manufactured devices in patients enrolled in a prospective physician-sponsored investigational device exemption protocol (NCT 1937949 and 2089607). Outcomes were reported for extent IV and extent I to III thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, including 30-day mortality, major adverse events, patient survival, primary target vessel patency, and reintervention.ResultsA total of 112 patients (60%) were treated for extent IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, and 73 patients (40%) were treated for extent I to III thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. Demographics and cardiovascular risk factors were similar in both groups. A total of 687 renal-mesenteric arteries (3.7 vessels/patient) were targeted by 540 fenestrations and 147 directional branches. Technical success was 94%. Thirty-day mortality was 4.3%, including a mortality of 1.8% for extent IV and 8.2% for extent I to III thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (P = .03). Mortality decreased in the second half of clinical experience from 7.5% to 1.2%, including a decrease of 3.3% to 0% for extent IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (P = .12) and 15.6% to 2.4% for extent I to III thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (P = .04). Early major adverse events occurred in 36 patients (32%) with extent IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms and 26 patients (36%) with extent I to III thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, including spinal cord injury in 2 patients (1.8%) and 4 patients (3.2%), respectively. Mean follow-up was 21 ± 20 months. At 5 years, patient survival (56% and 59%, P = .37) and freedom from any reintervention (50% and 53%, P = .26) were similar in those with extent IV and extent I to III thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. Primary patency was 93% at 5 years.ConclusionsEndovascular repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms can be performed with high technical success and low mortality and morbidity. However, the need for secondary reinterventions and continued graft surveillance represents major limitations compared with results of conventional open surgical repair. Long-term follow-up is needed before the widespread use of these techniques in younger or lower-risk patients.",Available online 22 October 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Gustavo S.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Oderich'}, {'given-name': 'Mauricio', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ribeiro'}, {'given-name': 'Leonardo', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Reis de Souza'}, {'given-name': 'Jan', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Hofer'}, {'given-name': 'Jean', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Wigham'}, {'given-name': 'Stephen', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Cha'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022522316313794,1-s2.0-S0022522316313794
Impact of Shaggy Aorta in Patients with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Following Open or Endovascular Aneurysm Repair,"ObjectiveTo analyze the impact of the presence of shaggy aorta on 30 day morbidity and mortality and long-term survival in patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.MethodsThis retrospective observational study included 447 consecutive patients who underwent AAA repair between January 2009 and December 2012. The study included 209 patients (47%) having open surgical repair (OSR) and 238 patients (53%) having endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).ResultsOf the 447 patients having elective AAA repair, 48 patients (11%) had shaggy aorta. Both the OSR (p = .005) and EVAR group (p = .007) demonstrated a higher 30 day morbidity and mortality in patients with shaggy aorta. On multivariate regression analysis, patients with shaggy aorta had 4.1 fold (95% CI = 1.7–9.7; p = .002) increase in 30 day morbidity and mortality. According to the Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with shaggy aorta had significantly decreased long-term overall survival in comparison with the non-shaggy group (log-rank test; p = .005), and this resulted from comorbidities.ConclusionsShaggy aorta is a prominent risk factor associated with 30 day morbidity and mortality. Poor long-term survival was expected in patients with shaggy aorta.",November 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'H.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kwon'}, {'given-name': 'Y.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Han'}, {'given-name': 'M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Noh'}, {'given-name': 'J.G.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Gwon'}, {'given-name': 'Y.-P.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Cho'}, {'given-name': 'T.-W.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kwon'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078588416303859,1-s2.0-S1078588416303859
Patient Specific Wall Stress Analysis and Mechanical Characterization of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Using 4D Ultrasound,"ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to perform wall stress analysis (WSA) using 4D ultrasound (US) in 40 patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The geometries and wall stress results were compared with computed tomography (CT) in seven patients. Additionally, the WSA models were calibrated using 4D motion estimation, resulting in patient specific material parameters that were compared among patients.Methods4D-US images were acquired for 40 patients (AAA diameter 27–52 mm). Patient specific AAA geometries and wall motion were extracted from the 4D-US. WSA was performed and corresponding patient specific material properties were derived. For seven patients, CT data were available and analyzed for geometry and wall stress comparison.ResultsThe 4D-US based 99th percentile wall stress ranged from 198 to 390 kPa. Regression analysis showed no significant relation between wall stress and diameter of the AAA. The similarity indices between US and CT were very good and ranged between 0.90 and 0.96, and the 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentile wall stresses of the US and CT data were in agreement. The characterized patient specific shear modulus had a median of 1.1 MPa (interquartile range, 0.7–1.4 MPa). Based on the maximum AAA diameter, the AAAs were divided in a small, medium, and large diameter groups. The largest AAAs revealed an increased wall stiffness compared with the smallest AAAs.Conclusions4D ultrasound is applicable for wall stress analysis of AAAs, and offers the opportunity to perform wall stress analysis over time, also for AAAs who do not qualify for a CT or magnetic resonance imaging. Moreover, the patient specific material properties can be determined, which could possibly improve risk assessment.",November 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'E.M.J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'van Disseldorp'}, {'given-name': 'N.J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Petterson'}, {'given-name': 'M.C.M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Rutten'}, {'given-name': 'F.N.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'van de Vosse'}, {'given-name': 'M.R.H.M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'van Sambeek'}, {'given-name': 'R.G.P.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Lopata'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078588416303355,1-s2.0-S1078588416303355
Massive Blood Transfusion in Patients with Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,"ObjectivesThe aim was to study blood transfusions and blood product ratios in massively transfused patients treated for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAAs).MethodsThis was a registry based cohort study of rAAA patients repaired at three major vascular centres between 2008 and 2013. Data were collected from the Swedish Vascular Registry, hospitals medical records, and local transfusion registries. The transfusion data were analysed for the first 24 h of treatment. Massive transfusion (MT) was defined as 4 or more units of red blood cell (RBC) transfused within 1 h, or 10 or more RBC units within 24 h. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio of 30 day mortality associated with the ratios of blood products and timing of first units of platelets (PLTs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfused.ResultsThree hundred sixty nine rAAA patients were included: 80% men; 173 endovascular aneurysm repairs (EVARs) and 196 open repairs (ORs) with median RBC transfusion 8 units (Q1–Q3, 4–14) and 14 units (Q1–Q3, 8–28), respectively. A total of 261 (71%) patients required MT. EVAR patients with MT (n = 96) required less transfusion than OR patients (n = 165): median RBC 10 units (Q1–Q3, 6–16.5) vs. 15 units (Q1–Q3, 9–26) (p = .002), FFP 6 units (Q1–Q3, 2–14.5) vs. 13 units (Q1–Q3, 7–24) (p &lt; .001), and PLT 0 units (Q1–Q3, 0–2) vs. 2 units (Q1–Q3, 0–4) (p = .01). Median blood product ratios in MT patients were FFP/RBC (EVAR group 0.59 [0.33–0.86], OR group 0.84 [0.67–1.2]; p &lt; .001], and PLT/RBC (EVAR 0 [0–0.17], OR 0.12 (0–0.18); p &lt; .001]. In patients repaired by OR a FFP/RBC ratio close to 1 was associated with reduced 30 day mortality (p = .003). The median PLT/RBC ratio was higher during the later part of the study period (p &lt; .001, median test), whereas there was no significant difference in median FFP/RBC ratio (p = .101, median test).ConclusionThe majority of rAAA patients undergoing EVAR required MT. EVAR patients treated with MT had lower FFP/RBC and PLT/RBC ratios than OR patients with MT. The mortality risk was lower with FFP/RBC ratio close to 1:1 in open repaired patients requiring MT. The 24 h PLT/RBC ratio increased over the study period.",November 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'C.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Montan'}, {'given-name': 'U.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Hammar'}, {'given-name': 'A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Wikman'}, {'given-name': 'E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Berlin'}, {'given-name': 'J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Malmstedt'}, {'given-name': 'J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Holst'}, {'given-name': 'C.M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Wahlgren'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078588416302684,1-s2.0-S1078588416302684

Rastreio populacional de aneurisma da aorta abdominal em Portugal – o imperativo da sua realização,"ResumoEm Portugal, a relação entre o número de aneurismas da aorta abdominal (AAA) tratados e a população total é das mais baixas descritas na literatura. Este fenómeno poderá ser justificado pelo défice de diagnóstico ou pela reduzida prevalência da doença na nossa população. Até à data, nenhum rastreio populacional sistemático foi realizado em Portugal. O rastreio oportunístico «A aorta não avisa» descreveu uma prevalência de 2,4% na população avaliada. Vários estudos demonstram o benefício do rastreio populacional de AAA, tendo‐se verificado diminuição da mortalidade específica e por todas as causas, pelo que este já é recomendado pelas principais sociedades internacionais de cirurgia vascular – European Society for Vascular Surgery (nível 1 recomendação) e Society for Vascular Surgery (nível 2 de recomendação) em homens com mais de 65 anos. Para além da sua justificação académica e científica, as vantagens de um programa de rastreio em termos de saúde pública são inegáveis e irrefutáveis com base na evidência atual.AbstractIn Portugal, the number of abdominal aortic aneurisms (AAA) treated in relation with its population is among the lowest in the literature. This phenomenon can be explained by a low diagnostic rate or a reduced prevalence of AAA in our population. To date, no systematic population screening was conducted in Portugal. The opportunistic screening “A aorta não avisa” described a prevalence of 2.4% in our population. Several studies have shown the benefit of population screening for AAA, by describing a significant decrease in specific and all‐cause mortality. In that way, the screening is already recommended in men over 65 years by the leading international Vascular Surgery societies ‐ European Society for Vascular Surgery (level 1 recommendation) and Society for Vascular Surgery (level 2 recommendation).

Association between diabetes and prevalence and growth rate of abdominal aortic aneurysms: A meta-analysis,"AbstractBackgroundAlthough the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) was lower in diabetes, the relationship between diabetes and AAA prevalence remains unclear. In this meta-analysis, we sought to clarify the effect of diabetes on prevalence and growth rate (GR) of AAA.MethodsWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane databases. Articles reporting the AAA prevalence in diabetic patients and diabetic effects in GR of AAA were included.ResultsForty-nine studies on AAA prevalence in diabetics and thirteen studies on effect of diabetes in GR of AAA were included for meta-analysis. A strongly negative association was found between diabetes and AAA prevalence in population based screening (odds ratio [OR]adjusted: 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.58–0.75) and prospective studies (ORadjusted: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.43–0.63), but not in case–control studies (ORadjusted: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.20–1.15). Similar association was found in North American (ORadjusted: 0.62; 95% CI 0.54–0.71) and European (ORadjusted: 0.45; 95% CI 0.33–0.62) studies. The strongly negative association remained consistent after stratification by time of data collection (up to -1995 [ORadjusted: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.53–0.80], 1996–2005 [ORadjusted: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.47–0.78], 2006 and beyond- [ORadjusted: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.53–0.85], and data collection time &gt;10years [ORadjusted: OR: 0.44; 95% CI 0.34–0.58]).

Animal Models Used to Explore Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms: A Systematic Review,"ObjectiveExperimental animal models have been used to investigate the formation, development, and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) for decades. New models are constantly being developed to imitate the mechanisms of human AAAs and to identify treatments that are less risky than those used today. However, to the authors' knowledge, there is no model identical to the human AAA. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the different types of animal models used to investigate the development, progression, and treatment of AAA and to highlight their advantages and limitations.MethodsA search protocol was used to perform a systematic literature search of PubMed and Embase. A total of 2,830 records were identified. After selection of the relevant articles, 564 papers on animal AAA models were included.ResultsThe most common models in rodents, including elastase, calcium chloride, angiotensin II, xenograft, and transgenic models, and the most common models in non-rodents, including chemically induced, graft models, and patch models, all have limitations with regard to the pathological interpretation of human AAA.ConclusionAlthough findings from animal models of AAAs cannot be directly translated to human AAAs, the identification and awareness of animal models of AAA will provide knowledge for further investigation and insight into human AAA disease.",October 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Lysgaard Poulsen'}, {'given-name': 'J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Stubbe'}, {'given-name': 'J.S.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Lindholt'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078588416302453,1-s2.0-S1078588416302453
Computational modelling of abdominal aortic aneurysms: Effect of suprarenal vs infrarenal positions,"AbstractAbdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are seen in both suprarenal and infrarenal positions though infrarenal is more common. Initiation and development of thrombosis and atherosclerosis in abdominal aneurysms and renal arteries have previously been correlated to areas of adverse haemodynamic conditions such as flow recirculation, low shear stress and high temporal oscillation in shear. However, it is still unknown if the haemodynamic perturbations arisen from different types of aneurysms, suprarenal vs infrarenal, contribute to the formation of atherosclerosis within the renal branches. In this work, virtual models of symmetric and asymmetric AAAs located above and below renal branches were simulated under resting and exercise conditions to determine the influence of location of the aneurysm on important haemodynamic parameters. The results showed that the size of the recirculation zones and vortices inside the renal branches and aneurysm region is considerably smaller in the infrarenal AAAs than the suprarenal models. Furthermore, our data demonstrated that occurrence of the aneurysm below the renal level augments the magnitude of shear stress and reduces the oscillations in shear in renal branches. These results confirm that the suprarenal AAA promotes thrombosis initiation within the aneurysm and increases the risk of endothelial dysfunction and the development of atherosclerosis in renal arteries. The findings also showed that under exercise conditions the haemodynamic differences between the suprarenal and infrarenal AAAs become less important and the local unfavourable haemodynamic conditions are improved to some extent.",Available online 20 September 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Ashkan', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Javadzadegan'}, {'given-name': 'Anne', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Simmons'}, {'given-name': 'Masud', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Behnia'}, {'given-name': 'Tracie', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Barber'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0997754616304186,1-s2.0-S0997754616304186
Biomechanical Imaging Markers as Predictors of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Growth or Rupture: A Systematic Review,"ObjectivesBiomechanical characteristics, such as wall stress, are important in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) and can be visualised and quantified using imaging techniques. This systematic review aims to present an overview of all biomechanical imaging markers that have been studied in relation to AAA growth and rupture.MethodsThis systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines. A search in Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library identified 1503 potentially relevant articles. Studies were included if they assessed biomechanical imaging markers and their potential association with growth or rupture.ResultsTwenty-seven articles comprising 1730 patients met the inclusion criteria. Eighteen studies performed wall stress analysis using finite element analysis (FEA), 13 of which used peak wall stress (PWS) to quantify wall stress. Ten of 13 case control FEA studies reported a significantly higher PWS for symptomatic or ruptured AAAs than for intact AAAs. However, in some studies there was confounding bias because of baseline differences in aneurysm diameter between groups. Clinical heterogeneity in methodology obstructed a meaningful meta-analysis of PWS. Three of five FEA studies reported a significant positive association between several wall stress markers, such as PWS and 99th percentile stress, and growth. One study reported a significant negative association and one other study reported no significant association. Studies assessing wall compliance, the augmentation index and wall stress analysis using Laplace's law, computational fluid dynamics and fluid structure interaction were also included in this systematic review.ConclusionsAlthough PWS is significantly higher in symptomatic or ruptured AAAs in most FEA studies, confounding bias, clinical heterogeneity, and lack of standardisation limit the interpretation and generalisability of the results. Also, there is conflicting evidence on whether increased wall stress is associated with growth.",October 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'R.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Indrakusuma'}, {'given-name': 'H.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Jalalzadeh'}, {'given-name': 'R.N.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Planken'}, {'given-name': 'H.A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Marquering'}, {'given-name': 'D.A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Legemate'}, {'given-name': 'M.J.W.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Koelemay'}, {'given-name': 'R.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Balm'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078588416302441,1-s2.0-S1078588416302441

Late Survival in Nonoperated Patients with Infrarenal Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,"Objective/BackgroundHistorical studies report high rupture rates in patients with nonoperated abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) of &gt; 5.5 cm diameter, although a recent audit has questioned this.MethodsThis was a retrospective review of 138/764 (18%) patients with AAAs evaluated in a preassessment anaesthetic clinic (PAC) between 2006 and 2012, who either did not undergo elective AAA repair or who underwent deferred repair. The remaining 626 underwent repair. Patients with severe comorbidities (dementia, advanced malignancy, life-expectancy &lt; 1 year) and not referred to PAC were excluded.ResultsAt a median of 27 months, 71 (52%) died, 36 (51%) following rupture. Cumulative survival, free from rupture or surgery for acute symptoms, was 96% at 1 year, 84% at 3 years, and 64% at 5 years, where baseline AAA diameters were 5.5–6.9 cm. For diameters ≥ 7 cm, survival, free from rupture, was 65% at 1 year, 29% at 3 years, and 0% at 5 years. Median interval to rupture was 47 months (AAA diameter 5.5–6.9 cm) and 21 months where baseline diameters were ≥ 7 cm. Rupture accounted for 32% of late deaths in patients with AAAs of 5.5–5.9 cm diameter, 46% in those with AAAs measuring 6.0–6.9 cm in diameter, and 71% in patients with AAA measuring ≥ 7 cm in diameter.ConclusionApproximately half of all late deaths in this nonoperated cohort were not AAA related, suggesting that even had repair been undertaken, it would not have prolonged patient survival. The incidence of rupture in “high-risk” patients with an AAA &lt; 7 cm diameter was &lt; 5% at 1 year, thereby giving ample time to optimise risk factors and improve pre-existing medical conditions prior to undertaking a deferred intervention. Even if these patients did not undergo surgical repair, the risk of late rupture was relatively low.

In comparison to traditional open repair, the endovascular approach is associated with significantly improved perioperative morbidity and mortality. The early survival benefit of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is sustained up to 3 years postoperatively, but longer-term life expectancy remains poor regardless of operative modality. Nonetheless, most abdominal aortic aneurysms are now repaired using endovascular stent grafts. The technology is not perfect as several postoperative complications, namely endoleak, stent-graft migration, and graft limb thrombosis, can develop and therefore lifelong imaging surveillance is required. In addition, a postoperative inflammatory response has been documented after endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms; the clinical significance of this finding has yet to be determined. Subsequently, the safety and applicability of endovascular stent grafts are likely to improve and expand with the introduction of newer-generation devices and with the simplification of fenestrated systems.",September 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Dean J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Arnaoutakis'}, {'given-name': 'Martin', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Zammert'}, {'given-name': 'Alan', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Karthikesalingam'}, {'given-name': 'Michael', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Belkin'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1521689616300349,1-s2.0-S1521689616300349
"Outcomes of type II endoleaks after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair: a single-center, retrospective study","AbstractPurposeThis study aims to determine incidence and outcomes of type II endoleaks (T2E) after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR).MethodsA retrospective review of procedural angiograms, computed tomography angiography, and medical records of 202 patients who underwent EVAR with the Gore Excluder stent graft was performed to determine presence and outcomes of T2E.ResultsMedian follow-up time for 163 patients meeting inclusion criteria [136 males (83%)] was 24.7 months (range=0.5–85.2 months). T2E occurred in 66/163 patients (40.5%). Aneurysm sac size was unchanged in 32/66 patients (48.5%), decreased in 22/66 (33.3%), and increased in 12/66 (18.2%). No aneurysm ruptures, conversion to open repair, or aneurysm-related deaths occurred.ConclusionT2E are a common occurrence after EVAR, often with benign outcome.

Silencing of hypoxia inducible factor-1α gene attenuated angiotensin Ⅱ-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice,"AbstractBackground and aimsWe aimed to determine the effect of HIF-1α, the main regulatory subunit of the hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), on the development of the abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).MethodsAAA was induced in ApoE−/− mice by angiotensinⅡ (AngⅡ) infusion. In vivo silencing of HIF-1α was achieved by transfection of lentivirus expressing HIF-1α shRNA.ResultsTime course analysis of the AngⅡ infusion model revealed that HIF-1α was persistently upregulated during a 28-day period of AAA development. Silencing of the HIF-1α gene reduced the aneurysm size (2.84 ± 1.96 mm vs. 1.41 ± 0.85 mm respectively at day 28, p = 0.0002). Silencing of HIF-1α also alleviated infiltration of macrophages (38.8 ± 14.7 vs. 11.4 ± 4.4 macrophages/0.1 mm2, p = 0.0006) and neovascularity (5.56 ± 2.14 vs. 1.27 ± 1.05 microvessels/0.1 mm2, p = 0.0008) in the AngⅡ infusion model, at day 28. The activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was also decreased by knockdown of HIF-1α. The early increased expression of pro-inflammatory factors, angiogenic factors, and MMPs during AAA induction was alleviated by HIF-1α silencing.ConclusionsActivation of HIF-1 signaling pathway participates in the Ang Ⅱ-induced AAA formation in mice.",September 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Le', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Yang'}, {'given-name': 'Lin', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Shen'}, {'given-name': 'Gang', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Li'}, {'given-name': 'Hai', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Yuan'}, {'given-name': 'Xing', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Jin'}, {'given-name': 'Xuejun', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Wu'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021915016303094,1-s2.0-S0021915016303094
Inflammation as a Predictor of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Growth and Rupture: A Systematic Review of Imaging Biomarkers,"BackgroundMethods are required to identify abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) at increased risk of rupture. Inflammatory characteristics of AAA can be visualised using advanced imaging techniques and have been proposed as potential predictors of aneurysm progression. The objective of this review was to determine which inflammatory imaging biomarkers are associated with AAA growth and rupture.MethodsA systematic review was carried out in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. The electronic databases of Medline (PubMed), Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched up to January 1, 2016 for studies to determine the potential association between inflammatory imaging biomarkers and AAA growth or rupture.ResultsSeven studies were included, comprising 202 AAA patients. 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET-CT) was evaluated in six studies. Magnetic resonance imaging with ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide (USPIO-MRI) was evaluated in one study. Two of six 18F-FDG PET-CT studies reported a significant negative correlation (r=.383, p = .015) or a significant negative association (p = .04). Four of six 18F-FDG PET-CT studies reported no significant association between 18F-FDG uptake and AAA growth. The single study investigating USPIO-MRI demonstrated that AAA growth was three times higher in patients with focal USPIO uptake in the AAA wall compared to patients with diffuse or no USPIO uptake in the wall (0.66 vs. 0.24 vs. 0.22 cm/y, p = .020). In the single study relating 18F-FDG uptake results to AAA rupture, the association was not significant.ConclusionsCurrent evidence shows contradictory associations between 18F-FDG uptake and AAA growth. Data on the association with rupture are insufficient. Based on the currently available evidence, neither 18F-FDG PET-CT nor USPIO-MRI can be implemented as growth or rupture prediction tools in daily practice. The heterogeneous results reflect the complex and partially unclear relationship between inflammatory processes and AAA progression.",September 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'H.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Jalalzadeh'}, {'given-name': 'R.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Indrakusuma'}, {'given-name': 'R.N.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Planken'}, {'given-name': 'D.A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Legemate'}, {'given-name': 'M.J.W.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Koelemay'}, {'given-name': 'R.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Balm'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078588416300697,1-s2.0-S1078588416300697
The relationship between temporal changes in proximal neck angulation and stent graft migration after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair,"AbstractObjectivesIn recent years, endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) for treating abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) has become quite prevalent in Japan. Though little information is available about temporal changes in proximal neck angulation due to the difficulties encountered in measuring the angle. Therefore, we examined temporal changes in proximal neck angulation and its relationship to stent graft migration after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.MethodsBetween June 2007 and March 2010, 159 patients underwent EVAR for treatment of fusiform abdominal aortic aneurysms at our hospital. This study focuses on the 80 patients among this group whose treatment sites and subsequent stent grafts were examined by contrast computed tomographic angiography (CTA) prior to surgery, directly after surgery (within 4 days) as well as 1 year and 2 years thereafter. We created curved multi-planer reconstruction images (CPR images) and measured the length of migration and neck angle using our method.ResultsAt 2 years after EVAR, the average length of proximal landing zone was 21.4 ± 9.2 mm. The average length of stent migration after two years was 1.41 ± 2.68 mm. The average neck angle was 33.9 degrees preoperatively and 29.9 degrees directly after surgery yielding a significant difference. However, one year and two years after surgery the average neck angle was 28.2 and 28.4 degrees, respectively.The number of patients experiencing a change equal to or greater than 6 degrees in the angle of the proximal neck between the preoperative condition and that directly after surgery was 16 (34.8%) with the use of Zenith stent-grafts (n=46) and 14 (41.2%) with the use of Excluder stent-grafts (n=34). There was no correlation between the proximal neck angle and migration of the proximal stent-graft. In addition, there was no correlation between the changes in proximal neck angle and the secondary intervention rate and the occurrence of endoleak.ConclusionThere was a significant change in the neck angle between the preoperative condition and the immediate postoperative condition. However, there was no clear relationship found between only the angle of the neck and proximal stent-graft migration. Postoperative changes in the proximal neck angle just after EVAR and subsequent temporal changes during a two-year follow-up period do not appear to predict stent-graft migration, secondary intervention rates or the occurrence of endoleak.",Available online 24 August 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Seisaku', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Tokunaga'}, {'given-name': 'Tsutomu', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ihara'}, {'given-name': 'Hiroshi', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Banno'}, {'given-name': 'Akio', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kodama'}, {'given-name': 'Masayuki', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sugimoto'}, {'given-name': 'Kimihiro', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Komori'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0890509616306665,1-s2.0-S0890509616306665
Editor's Choice – Self-referral to the NHS Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Programme,"IntroductionThe NHS Abdominal Aortic Screening Programme (NAAASP) invites men in their 65th year for screening, men over 65 may self-refer into the programme. Most studies have concentrated on those invited for screening, little is known about the self-referral group. Our aim was to provide a descriptive analysis of the men who self refer to NAAASP for screening.MethodInformation concerning basic demographic details and ultrasound results were recorded on the AAA SMaRT database. During nurse assessment data collected included smoking status, blood pressure, height, weight, and aspirin and statin therapy. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS®20.ResultsA total of 58,999 men have self-referred to the NAAASP since its inception. The mean age at self-referral was 73 (47–100). The mean aortic diameter was 1.9 cm (0.8–12.1). Increased self-referral rates were observed following organised publicity. The incidence of AAA was 4.1% (n = 2438) compared with 1.4% in the invited cohort (age 65 years), of these 7.6% (n = 186) were &gt;5.5 cm. Of the 186, 152 (81.7%) underwent surgery, of which 55.3% (n = 84) underwent EVAR. The 30-day mortality in the men treated electively was 0%. The mean time from referral to surgery was 69 (2–361) days, with 57.9% (n = 88) being treated within 8 weeks of detection.ConclusionSelf-referral has yielded higher detection rates than the invited cohort, more than justifying its cost. Now that NAAASP is fully operational it is important to continue media campaigns and publicity to target the “at-risk” men over 65 who would otherwise miss the benefits of AAA screening. Some key areas still need to be addressed.",September 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'L.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Meecham'}, {'given-name': 'J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Jacomelli'}, {'given-name': 'A.D.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Pherwani'}, {'given-name': 'J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Earnshaw'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078588416300363,1-s2.0-S1078588416300363
Influence of limited field-of-view on wall stress analysis in abdominal aortic aneurysms,"AbstractAbdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are local dilations of the aorta which can lead to a fatal hemorrhage when ruptured. Wall stress analysis of AAAs has been widely reported in literature to predict the risk of rupture. Usually, the complete AAA geometry including the aortic bifurcation is obtained by computed tomography (CT). However, performing wall stress analysis based on 3D ultrasound (3D US) has many advantages over CT, although, the field-of-view (FOV) of 3D US is limited and the aortic bifurcation is not easily imaged. In this study, the influence of a limited FOV is examined by performing wall stress analysis on CT-based (total) AAA geometries in 10 patients, and observing the changes in 99th percentile stresses and median stresses while systematically limiting the FOV.Results reveal that changes in the 99th percentile wall stresses are less than 10% when the proximal and distal shoulders of the aneurysm are in the shortened FOV. Wall stress results show that the presence of the aortic bifurcation in the FOV does not influence the wall stresses in high stress regions. Hence, the necessity of assessing the complete FOV, including the aortic bifurcation, is of minor importance. When the proximal and distal shoulders of the AAA are in the FOV, peak wall stresses can be detected adequately.",16 August 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Emiel M.J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'van Disseldorp'}, {'given-name': 'Koen H.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Hobelman'}, {'given-name': 'Niels J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Petterson'}, {'given-name': 'Frans N.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'van de Vosse'}, {'given-name': 'Marc R.H.M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'van Sambeek'}, {'given-name': 'Richard G.P.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Lopata'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021929016300306,1-s2.0-S0021929016300306
Noninvasive Regional Aortic Stiffness for Monitoring the Early Stage of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in Mice,"BackgroundAbdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) affects more than 5% of the population in developed countries. To study the formation and progression of AAA, we developed a non-invasive method to analyse regional aortic stiffness to monitor the formation and progression of AAA.MethodsSaline or Angiotensin II (AngII) was subcutaneously infused in apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE-/−) mice for 28 days; a high-resolution imaging system was used to identify changes in arterial stiffness measured by pulse-wave velocity (PWV) and aortic lumen diameter in the suprarenal aorta.ResultsBoth regional PWV and luminal diameter in the suprarenal aorta did not change significantly in saline-treated ApoE-/− mice for 28 days. In contrast, AngII treatment for 28 days rapidly increased both regional PWV and luminal diameter. The difference in luminal diameter could be identified at 14 days. However, regional PWV significantly increased within the first 7 days after AngII perfusion as compared with saline treatment. However, in ApoE-/− diabetic mice, both regional PWV and aortic diameter did not differ between AngII and saline treatment at 7 or 28 days.ConclusionsRegional PWV may be used to monitor AAA development and was improved after AngII infusion in ApoE-/− mice.",Available online 17 August 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Qiulun', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Lu'}, {'given-name': 'Xiuxin', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Jiang'}, {'given-name': 'Cheng', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Zhang'}, {'given-name': 'Wei', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Zhang'}, {'given-name': 'Wencheng', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Zhang'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1443950616315384,1-s2.0-S1443950616315384
Aneurisma da aorta abdominal – estudo epidemiológico de doentes tratados num centro por um período de 8 anos com o objetivo de promover o rastreio populacional,"ResumoIntroduçãoA rotura de um aneurisma aorta abdominal (AAA) é uma emergência cirúrgica com uma taxa de mortalidade estimada em 65‐85%. A cirurgia aberta tem uma elevada morbimortalidade, cerca de 40‐60%. No entanto, o rEVAR (Ruptured Endovascular Aneurysm Repair) não é consensual dada a ausência de evidência nível A. O rastreio de AAA é custo efetivo em doentes do sexo masculino, com idade superior a 65 anos, com uma redução de 44% na mortalidade específica por AAA. Este estudo retrospetivo teve 2 objetivos principais. Em primeiro lugar, a avaliação global dos cuidados prestados no tratamento desta patologia no nosso centro. Em segundo lugar, pretendeu‐se avaliar a amostra de aneurismas urgentes e eletivos tratados, e comparar a distribuição dessa amostra pelas diferentes regiões da nossa área de referenciação com o objetivo de sensibilizar os cuidados de saúde primários para esta patologia, para o seu mau prognóstico quando tratado em contexto de rotura e para a importância do rastreio de base populacional e do controlo de fatores de risco cardiovasculares, de forma a contribuir para uma diminuição da mortalidade específica por AAA.MétodosForam selecionados todos os doentes submetidos a tratamento de AAA entre 2007‐2014, quer em contexto urgente quer eletivo no nosso centro.ResultadosDurante o período estudado, foram realizados 155 procedimentos de reparação de AAA eletivos, 108 por cirurgia aberta e 47 por EVAR (Endovascular Aneurysm Repair). A taxa de mortalidade a 30 dias foi 1,3%. Foram realizados 51 procedimentos de reparação urgente de AAA em rotura (46 cirurgia aberta, 5 EVAR). Constatou‐se uma taxa de mortalidade intraoperatória de 15,7% e uma taxa de mortalidade precoce de 47%. Considerando a área de distribuição geográfica da população estudada, identificaram‐se assimetrias consideráveis na distribuição da amostra de AAA urgentes e eletivos.ConclusõesO outcome dos doentes tratados na nossa instituição é sobreponível aos dados divulgados na literatura. Avaliou‐se a distribuição regional por concelhos da amostra tratada no nosso centro com o objetivo de avaliar tendências na nossa amostra e, assim, enfatizar os casos de AAA tratados de forma urgente pertencentes a cada área regional de cada centro de saúde e, assim, incentivar o envolvimento ativo dos cuidados de saúde primários, quer no rastreio de AAA quer no tratamento, através de controlo de fatores de risco cardiovasculares nesses doentes.AbstractIntroductionThe rupture of an AAA is frequently fatal and accounts for nearly 1% of all deaths. Open surgical intervention is associated with high mortality, but EVAR (Endovascular Aneurysm Repair) is far from consensual owing to lack of level A evidence. Screening is cost effective in male patients over the age of 65 with a 44% reduction in AAA related mortality. This retrospective study had two endpoints, the first was the global assessment of care for both elective and urgent aneurysms in our institution. The second was raising awareness in local primary health care institutions for both the dismal prognosis of untreated AAA and the favorable prognosis of patients treated electively, using outcome data from our centre.MethodsData was extracted from the hospital database concerning urgent and elective repair of AAA from 2007 to 2014.ResultsOver the 8 year period, 155 elective aneurysm repairs were performed, 108 through open surgery and 47 through EVAR (with an increasing percentage with time). The early (30 days) mortality rate was 1.3%. We performed 51 aneurysm repairs for ruptured aneurysms (46 open surgery and 5 EVAR), with an intra‐operative mortality of 15.7% and early mortality of 47%. Concerning the geographic distribution of elective and urgent cases, we identified a tendency for assimetry in the distribution of elective and urgent repair of aneurysms. Unfortunately, due to lack of data concerning treatment of patients from our referral area in other centres and pre hospital mortality of ruptured aneurysms, no true incidence rates were possible to calculate.ConclusionsThe outcome of patients treated in our institution are comparable with data from literature We disclosed this data to all local primary health care institutions as well as the established recommendations for screening, with the final purpose of raising awareness for the active role they must have in the screening of AAA and treatment of this patients by controlling cardiovascular risk factors.",September 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Andreia', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Coelho'}, {'given-name': 'Miguel', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Lobo'}, {'given-name': 'Ricardo', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Gouveia'}, {'given-name': 'Pedro', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sousa'}, {'given-name': 'Jacinta', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Campos'}, {'given-name': 'Rita', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Augusto'}, {'given-name': 'Alexandra', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Canedo'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1646706X16300088,1-s2.0-S1646706X16300088
Branch graft patency after open repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms,"AbstractObjectivesThe long-term function of branch grafts to the visceral and renal arteries during open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair is unknown. We assessed the patency of single and multiple branch grafts with postoperative imaging studies in patients followed for up to 13 years.MethodsA total of 99 of 130 patients undergoing open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair who received a total of 298 branch grafts to the celiac, superior mesenteric, and renal arteries were evaluated with serial imaging studies at 6- to 12-month intervals. The mean duration of angiographic follow-up was 40.4 months and extended to 159 months. Thirty-three patients receiving 74 grafts were followed for more than 5 years, and 7 patents receiving 22 grafts were followed for more than 10 years. Eighty-four grafts were grafted to the celiac artery, 73 grafts were grafted to the superior mesenteric artery, 71 grafts were grafted to the left renal artery, and 70 grafts were grafted to the right renal artery.ResultsNine graft occlusions occurred in 6 patients. One of these patients died of intestinal ischemia after occlusion of the celiac and superior mesenteric artery grafts, and 1 patient developed occlusion of both renal artery grafts and remains on dialysis. Five graft occlusions in the other 4 patients were asymptomatic, and no interventions were required. One additional patient developed significant stenosis of the celiac, superior mesenteric, and right renal arteries and underwent successful percutaneous angioplasty. No other patient required intervention. Freedom from occlusion of the 298 grafts at 1, 5, and 10 years is 98%, 97%, and 93%, respectively.ConclusionsThis represents the largest series of patients with branch grafts for open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair with extended angiographic follow-up.

Using machine learning methods for predicting inhospital mortality in patients undergoing open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm,"AbstractAn abdominal aortic aneurysm is an abnormal dilatation of the aortic vessel at abdominal level. This disease presents high rate of mortality and complications causing a decrease in the quality of life and increasing the cost of treatment. To estimate the mortality risk of patients undergoing surgery is complex due to the variables associated. The use of clinical decision support systems based on machine learning could help medical staff to improve the results of surgery and get a better understanding of the disease. In this work, the authors present a predictive system of inhospital mortality in patients who were undergoing to open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Different methods as multilayer perceptron, radial basis function and Bayesian networks are used. Results are measured in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the classifiers, achieving an accuracy higher than 95%. The developing of a system based on the algorithms tested can be useful for medical staff in order to make a better planning of care and reducing undesirable surgery results and the cost of the post-surgical treatments.",August 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Ana', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Monsalve-Torra'}, {'given-name': 'Daniel', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ruiz-Fernandez'}, {'given-name': 'Oscar', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Marin-Alonso'}, {'given-name': 'Antonio', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Soriano-Payá'}, {'given-name': 'Jaime', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Camacho-Mackenzie'}, {'given-name': 'Marisol', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Carreño-Jaimes'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1532046416300612,1-s2.0-S1532046416300612
IL-6: A Janus-like factor in abdominal aortic aneurysm disease,"AbstractBackground and aimsAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is part of the atherosclerotic spectrum of diseases. The disease is hallmarked by a comprehensive localized inflammatory response with striking IL-6 hyperexpression. IL-6 is a multifaceted cytokine that, depending on the context, acts as a pro- or anti-inflammatory factor. In this study, we explore a putative role for IL-6 in AAA disease.MethodsELISA’s, Western blot analysis, real time PCR and array analysis were used to investigate IL-6 expression and signaling in aneurysm wall samples from patients undergoing elective AAA repair. A role for IL-6 in AAA disease was tested through IL-6 neutralization experiments (neutralizing antibody) in the elastase model of AAA disease.ResultsWe confirmed an extreme disparity in aortic wall IL-6 content between AAA and atherosclerotic disease (median [5th–95th percentile] aortic wall IL-6 content: 281.6 [0.0–1820.8] (AAA) vs. 1.9 [0.0–37.8] μg/g protein (atherosclerotic aorta), (p &lt; 0.001). Array analysis followed by pathway analysis showed that IL-6 hyper-expression is followed by increased IL-6 signaling (p &lt; 0.000039), an observation confirmed by higher aneurysm wall pSTAT3 levels, and SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA expression, (p &lt; 0.018).Remarkably, preventive IL-6 neutralization i.e. treatment started one day prior to the elastase-induction resulted in &gt;40% 7-day mortality due to aortic rupture. In contrast, delayed IL-6 neutralization (i.e. neutralization started at day 4 after elastase induction) did not result in ruptures, and quenched AAA growth (p &lt; 0.021).ConclusionsAAA disease is characterized by increased IL-6 signaling.

"Plasma ferritin concentrations are not associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm diagnosis, size or growth","AbstractBackground and aimsExperimental studies using a rodent model have suggested that iron overload may contribute to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) pathogenesis.MethodsWe assessed the association of total body iron, as measured by plasma ferritin, with AAA diagnosis, size and growth in 4024 community-dwelling older men screened for AAA, using logistic regression and linear mixed effects models.ResultsPlasma ferritin concentrations were similar in men who did (n = 293) and did not (n = 3731) have an AAA (median [inter-quartile range] concentrations 115.4 [63.0–203.1] and 128.5 [66.1–229.1] ng/mL respectively, p = 0.124). There was no association between plasma ferritin concentration and AAA diagnosis in unadjusted logistic regression (odds ratio (OR) for a 1 standard deviation increase: 0.880 [95%CI: 0.764–1.015]; p = 0.078), or when adjusting for AAA risk factors and factors known to influence circulating ferritin (OR for a 1 standard deviation increase: 0.898 [95% CI: 0.778–1.035]; p = 0.138). Iron overload prevalence (plasma ferritin concentrations &gt;200 ng/mL) was lower in men with an AAA (25.3%) than those without (30.8%; p = 0.048), but was not associated with AAA diagnosis after adjusting as above (OR: 0.781 [95% CI:0.589–1.035]; p = 0.086). The association of iron overload with AAA growth was investigated in 265 men with small AAAs who received at least 1 repeat ultrasound scan in the 3 years following screening. We saw no difference in AAA growth between men who did and did not have iron overload (n = 65 and 185 respectively, p = 0.164).ConclusionsOur data suggest that iron overload is unlikely to be important in AAA pathogenesis.",August 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Joseph V.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Moxon'}, {'given-name': 'Rhondda E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Jones'}, {'given-name': 'Paul E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Norman'}, {'given-name': 'Paula', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Clancy'}, {'given-name': 'Leon', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Flicker'}, {'given-name': 'Osvaldo P.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Almeida'}, {'given-name': 'Graeme J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Hankey'}, {'given-name': 'Bu B.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Yeap'}, {'given-name': 'Jonathan', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Golledge'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002191501630199X,1-s2.0-S002191501630199X
Editor's Choice – Abdominal Compartment Syndrome After Surgery for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: A Nationwide Population Based Study,"Objective/BackgroundThe understanding of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), and its importance for outcome, has increased over time. The aim was to investigate the incidence and clinical consequences of ACS after open (OR) and endovascular repair (EVAR) for ruptured and intact infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA and iAAA, respectively).MethodsIn 2008, ACS and decompression laparotomy (DL) were introduced as variables in the Swedish vascular registry (Swedvasc), offering an opportunity to study this complication in a prospective, population based design. Operations carried out in the period 2008–13 were analysed. Of 6,612 operations, 1,341 (20.3%) were for rAAA (72.0% OR) and 5,271 (79.7%) for iAAA (41.9% OR). In all, 3,171 (48.0%) were operated on by OR and 3,441 by EVAR. Prophylactic open abdomen (OA) treatment was validated through case records. Cross-matching with the national population registry secured valid mortality data.ResultsAfter rAAA repair, ACS developed in 6.8% after OR versus 6.9% after EVAR (p = 1.0). All major complications were more common after ACS (p &lt; .001). Prophylactic OA was performed in 10.7% of patients after OR. For ACS, DL was performed in 77.3% after OR and 84.6% after EVAR (p = .433). The 30 day mortality rate was 42.4% with ACS and 23.5% without ACS (p &lt; .001); at 1 year it was 50.7% versus 31.8% (p &lt; .001). After iAAA repair, ACS developed in 1.6% of patients after OR versus 0.5% after EVAR (p &lt; .001). Among those with ACS, DL was performed in 68.6% after OR and in 25.0% after EVAR (p = .006). Thirty day mortality was 11.5% with ACS versus 1.8% without it (p &lt; .001); at 1 year it was 27.5% versus 6.3% (p &lt; .001). When ACS developed, renal failure, multiple organ failure, intestinal ischaemia, and prolonged intensive care were much more frequent (p &lt; .001). Morbidity and mortality were similar, regardless of primary surgical technique (OR/EVAR/iAAA/rAAA).ConclusionACS and OA were common after treatment for rAAA. ACS is a devastating complication after surgery for rAAA and iAAA, irrespective of operative technique, emphasizing the importance of prevention.",August 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'S.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ersryd'}, {'given-name': 'K.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Djavani-Gidlund'}, {'given-name': 'A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Wanhainen'}, {'given-name': 'M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Björck'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078588416001684,1-s2.0-S1078588416001684
Extent II Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair: How I Do It,"The primary risks associated with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair–namely operative death, paraplegia, and renal failure necessitating dialysis—are commonly related to the distal ischemia that occurs during aortic clamping and the disruption of vital branching arteries. Our technique for open TAAA repair has evolved over the course of 3 decades, from the unheparinized, simple “clamp-and-sew” approach learned directly from E. Stanley Crawford himself to a contemporary, multimodal strategy that uses an array of surgical adjuncts. Today, our approach to TAAA repair is largely standardized and based on the Crawford extents of TAAA repair, but we have maintained flexibility to explore new techniques and to adapt to the specific needs of patients. To protect the spinal cord, we routinely use mild passive hypothermia, cerebrospinal fluid drainage, left heart bypass, and reimplantation of crucial intercostal or lumbar arteries. The renal arteries are perfused with cold solution to protect the kidneys from ischemic damage, and the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery are perfused with isothermic blood from the left heart bypass circuit, which minimizes the duration of abdominal-organ ischemia. The most extensive repair, Crawford extent II repair, typically replaces the aorta from just beyond the left subclavian artery to the aortic bifurcation; unsurprisingly, it commonly poses greater operative risk than do less extensive TAAA repairs (extent I, III, and IV). Subsequently, most surgical adjuncts used today were developed to ameliorate risk in extent II repair. Here, we provide a detailed description of our approach to open extent II TAAA repair.",Available online 17 July 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Joseph S.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Coselli'}, {'given-name': 'Kim I.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'de la Cruz'}, {'given-name': 'Ourania', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Preventza'}, {'given-name': 'Scott A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'LeMaire'}, {'given-name': 'Scott A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Weldon'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S104306791630079X,1-s2.0-S104306791630079X

Editor's Choice – High Heritability of Liability to Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms: A Population Based Twin Study,"ObjectiveFirst degree relatives of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) have an increased risk of developing AAA; however, despite intensive investigation, the specific genetic factors involved in the development of the disease are still largely unknown. In twin studies the influence of genetic and environmental factors can be assessed by comparing concordance rates between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins. Higher phenotypic similarity between MZ than DZ twins indicates a genetic attribution to the etiology. The objective of this study was to investigate the heritability of AAA among Danish twins using concordance rates and heritability estimates.MethodsThe Danish Twin Registry was used to identify all Danish twin pairs (born 1880–1971) where both twins were alive on January 1, 1977. AAA cases were then identified using the National Patient Registry and the Registry of Cause of Death. Probandwise concordance rates were calculated and heritability estimated using structural equation modeling.ResultsThe study identified 414 twins with AAA; 69.8% (289/414) were men and 30.2% (125/414) women. The probandwise concordance rate in MZ twins was 30% (95% CI 20.3–43.3%) compared with 12% (95% CI 7.0–20.1%) in DZ twins. In the heritability analysis 77% (95% CI 67–85%) of the total variance was explained by additive genetic components and 23% (95% CI 15–33%) was explained by non-shared environmental factors.ConclusionsThe probandwise concordance rate was found to be 2.5 times higher in MZ compared with DZ twins.

Prevalence of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in Men Aged 65–74 Years in a Metropolitan Area in North-East Spain,"BackgroundA declining prevalence of AAA and a shift in the distribution towards the older population have been observed during the last decade in Europe. The aim was to estimate the current screening prevalence of AAA in men aged 65–74 years in a metropolitan area in north-east Spain and to identify associated risk factors.MethodsA cross sectional prevalence study in men registered in L'Hospitalet Primary Healthcare Services (Barcelona, Spain) was performed. There were 619 randomly selected subjects (expected prevalence of aneurysm, 5%; accuracy of estimation, ±2%; loss to follow up, 30%). Exclusion criteria were life expectancy &lt;1 year, limited quality of life, previous diagnosis of AAA, prior aorto-femoral surgery, and non-Caucasian. The following were measured: internal diameter of the infrarenal abdominal aorta using ultrasound, cardiovascular risk factors, personal (heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease) and family history (AAA), physical examination, and blood tests. We estimated the prevalence and 95% confidence interval of AAA, and used logistic regression analysis to identify risk factors for AAA.ResultsAmong the 651 individuals included in the analysis the prevalence of aneurysm was 2.30% (95% CI, 1.30–3.77%). In the regression analysis, AAA was associated with smoking (0–10, 11–20, or &gt;20 cigarettes/day), diagnosis of myocardial infarction, and being taller than the median (165 cm).ConclusionsThe current screening prevalence of AAA among men aged 65–74 years in a metropolitan area in north-east Spain is similar to that in northern Europe.

Midterm Re-interventions and Survival After Endovascular Versus Open Repair for Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,"ObjectiveTo compare the midterm re-intervention and survival rates after EVAR and OR for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAA).MethodsObservational cohort study including all consecutive RAAA patients between 2004 and 2011 in 10 hospitals in the Amsterdam ambulance region. The primary end point was re-interventions within 5 years of the primary intervention. The secondary end point was death. The outcomes were estimated by survival analyses, compared using the logrank test, and subsequently adjusted for possible confounders using Cox proportional hazard models. Re-interventions were estimated in all patients and in patients who survived their hospital stay.ResultsOf 467 patients with a RAAA, 73 were treated by EVAR and 394 by OR. Five years after the primary intervention, the rates of freedom from re-intervention were 55% for EVAR (26/73, 95% CI: 41–69%) and 60% for OR (130/394, 95% CI: 55–66%) (p = .96). After adjustment for age, sex, comorbidity, and pre-operative hemodynamic stability, the risk of re-intervention was similar (HR 1.01, 95% CI: 0.65–1.55). The survival rates were 36% for EVAR (45/73, 95% CI: 24–47%) and 38% for OR (235/394, 95% CI: 33–43%) (p = .83). In 297 patients who survived their hospital stay, the rates of freedom from re-intervention were 66% for EVAR (15/54, 95% CI: 52–81%) and 90% for OR (20/243, 95% CI: 86–95%) (p &lt; .01). After adjustment for age and sex, the risk of re-intervention was higher after EVAR (HR 0.27, 95% CI: 0.14–0.52).ConclusionsFive years after the primary intervention, endovascular and open repair for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm resulted in similar re-intervention and survival rates.

Protective effect of melatonin on the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm in a rat model,"AbstractBackgroundOxidative injury, inflammation, and apoptosis are involved in the progression of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Melatonin (MLT) has been reported with an effective antioxidant activity. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether MLT could suppress the development of AAA.MethodsThe AAA model was introduced by intraluminal perfusion of elastase in rats. All rats were divided into three groups as follows: (1) sham; (2) AAA + vehicle; and (3) AAA + MLT. Daily administration of MLT (10 mg/kg/d) or vehicle started 3 d before the perfusion and continued for 28 d after perfusion. An ultrasound system was applied to measure the dilation of the aorta. Histologic assays were performed to evaluate the structure, morphology, and apoptotic cells of the aortas; biochemical assays to determine the levels of proteins and lipid peroxide, activities of superoxide dismutase and NADPH oxidases, and cell viability; dihydroethidium fluorescence staining and flow cytometry to detect the presence of reactive oxygen species, and/or cell apoptosis; and electron microscopy to observe the ultrastructure of mitochondria. Cell lines A7R5 and RAW 264.7 were used for in vitro experiments.ResultsMLT treatment inhibited dilation of the aorta very likely through its antioxidant property; significantly reduced the levels of lipid peroxide, activities of NADPH oxidases, and content of reactive oxygen species; remarkably inhibited NF-κB signaling pathway and activities of matrix metalloproteinases triggered by elastase perfusion. As a result, the mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis was suppressed, cellular energy (ATP) supply was recovered, and mitochondrial morphology remained intact.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate the beneficial effects of MLT on inhibition of AAA formation, suggesting that MLT could be a potential agent for prevention of the development of human AAA.",Available online 16 June 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Li', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Tang'}, {'given-name': 'Zhuangzhuang', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Cong'}, {'given-name': 'Shuangying', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Hao'}, {'given-name': 'Peng', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Li'}, {'given-name': 'Hairong', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Huang'}, {'given-name': 'Yi', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Shen'}, {'given-name': 'Kuanyu', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Li'}, {'given-name': 'Hua', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Jing'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022480416301391,1-s2.0-S0022480416301391
Aplicação do Glasgow Aneurysm Score como modelo preditivo de mortalidade em doentes com rutura de aneurisma da aorta abdominal,"ResumoIntroduçãoO updated Glasgow Aneurysm Score (uGAS), projetado para prever a mortalidade/morbilidade perioperatórias após rAAA, revelou ser um bom preditor de resultados a curto prazo após o tratamento com cirurgia convencional (CC) e Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR). Os objetivos foram caracterizar os doentes operados a Aneurisma da Aorta Abdominal roto (AAAr) e avaliar a aplicabilidade do uGAS na população de doentes de uma instituição terciária nacional, com capacidade de rEVAR.MétodosFizemos uma análise retrospetiva dos doentes operados, no nosso serviço, a AAAr entre fevereiro/2011 e fevereiro/2015. As variáveis foram obtidas através da pesquisa numa base de dados de AAAr da instituição e incluíram: idade, sexo, presença de doença cardíaca, doença cerebrovascular, doença renal aguda/crónica e existência de choque pré‐operatório. Foi obtida a mortalidade perioperatória (30 dias ou intra‐hospitalar). O score de risco foi aplicado retrospetivamente e a mortalidade esperada foi comparada com a mortalidade obtida.ResultadosForam incluídos 89 doentes. Quarenta e nove (55%) foram tratados por CC e os restantes 40 (45%) por EVAR. Trinta e cinco por cento apresentavam doença cardíaca, 12% doença cerebrovascular, 45% doença renal e 25% choque pré‐operatório. O uGAS médio foi de 90,6±16,7. Não se encontraram diferenças estatisticamente significativas entre doentes submetidos a CC e EVAR, relativamente ao uGAS (p=0,105). A mortalidade aos 30 dias foi de 39,8%, tendo sido significativamente menor nos doentes submetidos a EVAR do que nos submetidos a CC (20 vs. 55%; p=0,001).Os doentes que morreram eram significativamente mais jovens (70 vs. 76 anos; p=0,031), apresentavam maior prevalência de doença renal (55 vs. 45%; p=0,008), choque (59 vs. 41%; p=0,033) e um uGAS mais elevado (100±12,5 vs. 84,6±16,3; p&lt;0,001). A mortalidade dos doentes com uGAS&lt;=85 foi 14,3% e dos doentes com uGAS&gt;85 foi 56,6%.ConclusãoOs resultados demonstram a aplicabilidade do score uGAS para estratificação do risco num coorte nacional de doentes com AAAr em que o EVAR é uma alternativa disponível. Contudo, uma vez que não foi possível identificar um cut‐off capaz de prever uma mortalidade de 100%, ressalvamos que a utilização de scores compreende o risco de recusa de tratamento a doentes que poderiam eventualmente sobreviver. Adicionalmente, estes resultados sugerem que o tratamento dos AAAr por EVAR se associa a melhores resultados.AbstractIntroductionThe updated Glasgow Aneurysm Score (uGAS), designed to predict mortality/morbidity perioperative after rAAA, proved to be a good predictor of short term results after treatment with conventional surgery (CC) and EVAR. The objectives were to characterize patients operated at rAAA and evaluate the applicability of uGAS in the population of a national tertiary institution with rEVAR capacity.MethodsWe did a retrospective analysis of patients operated in our service to rAAA between February/2011 to February/2015. The variables were obtained through a search in a database of the institution and included age; sex; presence of heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, acute/chronic kidney disease and preoperative shock. Perioperative mortality (30‐day or in‐hospital) was obtained. The risk score was applied retrospectively and expected mortality compared with the mortality that was obtained.Results89 patients were included. 49 (55%) were treated by CC and the remaining 40 (45%) by EVAR. 35% had heart disease, 12% cerebrovascular disease, kidney disease 45% and 25% preoperative shock. The average uGAS was 90.6±16.7. There were no statistically significant differences between patients undergoing EVAR or CC respecting to uGAS (p=0,105). Mortality at 30 days was 39.8% and was significantly lower in patients undergoing EVAR than in those undergoing CC (20% vs 55%; p=0.001).Patients who died were significantly younger (70 vs. 76 years, p=0.031), had a higher prevalence of kidney disease (55% vs 45%; p=0.008), shock (59% vs 41%; p=0.033) and a higher uGAS (100±12,5 vs 84.6±16,3; p&lt;0.001). The mortality of patients with uGAS &lt;=85 was 14.3% and patients with uGAS &gt;85 was 56.6%.ConclusionThe results demonstrate the applicability of the uGAS score for risk stratification in a National cohort of patients with RAAA that EVAR is an alternative available. However, since it was not possible to identify a cut‐off able to provide a mortality of 100% We point out that the use of scores comprises the risk of treating patients refusing that could possibly survive.

Cost-effectiveness of Screening for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in Combination with Medical Intervention in Patients with Small Aneurysms,"ObjectivesScreening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) among 65 year old men has been proven cost-effective, but nowadays is conducted partly under new conditions. The prevalence of AAA has decreased, and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has become the predominant surgical method for AAA repair in many centers. At the Malmö Vascular Center pharmacological secondary prevention with statins, antiplatelet therapy, and blood pressure reduction is initiated and given to all patients with AAA. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of AAA screening under the above mentioned conditions.MethodsThis was a Markov cohort simulation. A total of 4,300 65 year old men were invited to annual AAA screening; the attendance rate was 78.3% and AAA prevalence was 1.8%. A Markov model with 11 health states was used to evaluate cost-effectiveness of AAA screening. Background data on rupture risks, costs, and effectiveness of surgical interventions were obtained from the participating unit, the national Swedvasc Registry, and from the scientific literature.ResultsThe additional costs of the screening strategy compared with no screening were €169 per person and year.

Patient-specific modelling of abdominal aortic aneurysms: The influence of wall thickness on predicted clinical outcomes,"AbstractRupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is linked to aneurysm morphology. This study investigates the influence of patient-specific (PS) AAA wall thickness on predicted clinical outcomes. Eight patients under surveillance for AAAs were selected from the MA3RS clinical trial based on the complete absence of intraluminal thrombus. Two finite element (FE) models per patient were constructed; the first incorporated variable wall thickness from CT (PS_wall), and the second employed a 1.9mm uniform wall (Uni_wall). Mean PS wall thickness across all patients was 1.77±0.42mm. Peak wall stress (PWS) for PS_wall and Uni_wall models was 0.6761±0.3406N/mm2 and 0.4905±0.0850N/mm2, respectively. In 4 out of 8 patients the Uni_wall underestimated stress by as much as 55%; in the remaining cases it overestimated stress by up to 40%. Rupture risk more than doubled in 3 out of 8 patients when PS_wall was considered. Wall thickness influenced the location and magnitude of PWS as well as its correlation with curvature. Furthermore, the volume of the AAA under elevated stress increased significantly in AAAs with higher rupture risk indices. This highlights the sensitivity of standard rupture risk markers to the specific wall thickness strategy employed.",June 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Noel', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Conlisk'}, {'given-name': 'Arjan J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Geers'}, {'given-name': 'Olivia M.B.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'McBride'}, {'given-name': 'David E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Newby'}, {'given-name': 'Peter R.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Hoskins'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1350453316300224,1-s2.0-S1350453316300224
Outcomes of 3309 thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repairs,"AbstractObjectiveSince the pioneering era of E. Stanley Crawford, our multimodal strategy for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair has evolved. We describe our approximately 3-decade single-practice experience regarding 3309 thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repairs and identify predictors of early death and other adverse postoperative outcomes.MethodsWe analyzed retrospective (1986-2006) and prospective data (2006-2014) obtained from patients (2043 male; median age, 67 [59-73] years) who underwent 914 Crawford extent I, 1066 extent II, 660 extent III, and 669 extent IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repairs, of which 723 (21.8%) were urgent or emergency. Repairs were performed to treat degenerative aneurysm (64.2%) or aortic dissection (35.8%). The outcomes examined included operative death (ie, 30-day or in-hospital death) and permanent stroke, paraplegia, paraparesis, and renal failure necessitating dialysis, as well as adverse event, a composite of these outcomes.ResultsThere were 249 operative deaths (7.5%). Permanent paraplegia and paraparesis occurred after 97 (2.9%) and 81 (2.4%) repairs, respectively. Of 189 patients (5.7%) with permanent renal failure, 107 died in the hospital. Permanent stroke was relatively uncommon (n = 74; 2.2%). The rate of the composite adverse event (n = 478; 14.4%) was highest after extent II repair (n = 203; 19.0%) and lowest after extent IV repair (n = 67; 10.2%; P &lt; .0001). Estimated postoperative survival was 83.5% ± 0.7% at 1 year, 63.6% ± 0.9% at 5 years, 36.8% ± 1.0% at 10 years, and 18.3% ± 0.9% at 15 years.ConclusionsRepairing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms poses substantial risks, particularly when the entire thoracoabdominal aorta (extent II) is replaced. Nonetheless, our data suggest that thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair, when performed at an experienced center, can produce respectable outcomes.",May 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Joseph S.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Coselli'}, {'given-name': 'Scott A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'LeMaire'}, {'given-name': 'Ourania', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Preventza'}, {'given-name': 'Kim I.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'de la Cruz'}, {'given-name': 'Denton A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Cooley'}, {'given-name': 'Matt D.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Price'}, {'given-name': 'Alan P.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Stolz'}, {'given-name': 'Susan Y.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Green'}, {'given-name': 'Courtney N.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Arredondo'}, {'given-name': 'Todd K.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Rosengart'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022522316000222,1-s2.0-S0022522316000222

New Scale for Predicting Mortality in Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,"AbstractIntroductionTo determine the usefulness of mortality risk scores for the endovascular treatment of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms.MethodsRetrospective study of 61 patients undergoing endovascular repair between 2009 and 2014. Preoperative variables and in-hospital mortality were collected. The Hardman, GAS, Vancouver and ERAS scales were calculated.ResultsIn-hospital mortality was 45.9%. The univariate predictors obtained were age, male sex, hypertension, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, systolic blood pressure &lt;90mmHg, heart rate, and loss of consciousness. After completing the multivariate analysis, significant variables were age (P=.021), systolic blood pressure &lt;90mmHg (P=.004) and heart rate (P=.050). The GAS (76.79±9.88 vs 90.43±14.76, P=.001), Vancouver (4.41±0.62 vs 4.83±0.55, P=.007), and ERAS scales (0.06±0.24 vs 0.86±0.76, P=.001) were statistically different between the groups. The scale resulting from the following formula: 0.083+0.158 (if age&gt;80 years)+0.701 (if systolic blood pressure&lt;80mmHg)+0.598 (if heart rate&lt;70 beats/min); obtained an area under the curve of 0.95.ConclusionsAge, systolic pressure and heart rate, are predictors of hospital mortality of patients treated with endovascular repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. Applying the scale proposed in this study, in combination with GAS, Vancouver, and ERAS scales, allows the detection of patients who would not benefit from endovascular treatment.",June–July 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Enrique M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'San Norberto'}, {'given-name': 'Ruth', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Fuente'}, {'given-name': 'Irene', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'García-Saiz'}, {'given-name': 'Alvaro', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Revilla'}, {'given-name': 'Miguel', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Martín-Pedrosa'}, {'given-name': 'Carlos', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Vaquero'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S217350771630062X,1-s2.0-S217350771630062X
Imatinib treatment attenuates growth and inflammation of angiotensin II induced abdominal aortic aneurysm,"AbstractBackgroundAbdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is characterized by vascular remodeling with increased infiltration of inflammatory cells and apoptosis/modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Imatinib is a selective inhibitor of several tyrosine kinases, including PDGF receptors, Abl, and c-kit. The objective of this study was to characterize the potential protective role of imatinib on AAA development and the molecular mechanisms involved.MethodsMale ApoE−/− mice were infused with angiotensin (Ang) II (1000 ng/kg/min) for 4 weeks to induce AAA or saline as controls. Daily treatment with 10 mg/kg imatinib, or tap water as control, was provided via gavage for 4 weeks.ResultsTreatment with imatinib was found to decrease the aortic diameter and vessel wall thickness, mediated by multiple effects. Imatinib treatment in AngII infused mice resulted in a reduced cellular infiltration of CD3ε positive T lymphocytes by 86% and reduced gene expression of mast cell chymase by 50% compared with AngII infused mice lacking imatinib. Gene expression analysis of SMC marker SM22α demonstrated an increase by 48% together with a more intact medial layer after treatment with imatinib as evaluated with SM22α immunostaining.ConclusionPresent findings highlight the importance of tyrosine kinase pathways in the development of AAA. Our results show, that imatinib treatment inhibits essential mast cell, T lymphocyte and SMC mediated processes in experimental AAA. Thus, our results support the idea that tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of pathological vascular inflammation and remodeling in conditions like AAA.",June 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Emina', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Vorkapic'}, {'given-name': 'Elma', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Dugic'}, {'given-name': 'Svante', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Vikingsson'}, {'given-name': 'Joy', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Roy'}, {'given-name': 'Mikko I.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Mäyränpää'}, {'given-name': 'Per', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Eriksson'}, {'given-name': 'Dick', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Wågsäter'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002191501630137X,1-s2.0-S002191501630137X

"Non-invasive Treatment of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Clinical Trial (N-TA3CT): Design of a Phase IIb, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial of doxycycline for the reduction of growth of small abdominal aortic aneurysm","AbstractObjectivesThe Non-Invasive Treatment of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Clinical Trial (N-TA3CT) is a Phase IIb randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, testing doxycycline (100mg bid) for inhibition of growth in the greatest transverse, orthogonal diameter of small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).MethodsWe will enroll 258 patients, ≥55years of age who have AAA, men: 3.5–5.0cm and women: 3.5–4.5cm on CT scans confirmed centrally. The primary outcome is growth in maximal transverse, orthogonal diameter from baseline to 24-month follow-up. Secondary analyses address doxycycline effects on clinical events, aneurysm volume, and biomarkers. Primary analysis will be performed according to the principle of intention-to-treat accounting for death and ruptures by use of normal scores in analysis of covariance. At the time of the data file reported, 200 subjects have been randomized. We started enrollment in mid-2013 and will complete enrollment by mid-2016.ResultsParticipant average age=70.9years, (SD=7.6years) and maximum transverse diameter=4.3cm for men (SD=0.4) and 4.0cm for women (SD=0.3).ConclusionN-TA3CT is a critical experiment to determine whether doxycycline reduces growth of small AAA and systemic markers of inflammation previously seen in bench experiments and observational human studies to be associated with AAA growth. Our patient population baseline measurements agree with the design assumptions supporting our expectation of 90% power or greater to reject a null hypothesis in favor of an alternative hypothesis when growth is reduced by at least 40%.

Impacto da insuficiência renal no prognóstico dos doentes submetidos a reparação de aneurisma da aorta abdominal – Cirurgia convencional vs. Tratamento Endovascular do Aneurisma da Aorta,"ResumoIntroduçãoA correção cirúrgica do aneurisma da aorta abdominal (AAA), por Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) ou cirurgia convencional (CC), pode agravar a função renal a curto prazo. Esta complicação, mais frequente nos doentes com insuficiência renal crónica (IRC), associa‐se a pior prognóstico a longo prazo. O objetivo deste trabalho foi quantificar o agravamento da função renal após reparação do AAA em doentes com IRC prévia e demonstrar o consequente aumento da morbimortalidade.MétodosEstudo retrospetivo em doentes com IRC estádios Chronic Kidney Disease 3‐4 (TFGe 15‐59ml/min), submetidos a correção eletiva de AAA entre fevereiro/2011 e fevereiro/2015 numa instituição terciária. Variáveis estudadas: idade, sexo, tipo de intervenção (convencional/EVAR) e estádio CKD. Endpoints: variação da creatinina e taxa de filtração glomerular com a cirurgia, complicações renais pós‐operatórias, necessidade de reintervenção cirúrgica e mortalidade. A análise estatística foi realizada em SPSS.ResultadosForam incluídos 71 doentes. Quinze doentes (21%) foram operados por CC e 56 (78%) por EVAR. À data da intervenção, os doentes encontravam‐se nos seguintes estádios da DRC: CKD 3 – 65 (91%) e CKD 4 – 6 (9%). A variação da TFG com a cirurgia foi −1,08±18,01mg/dl. Verificou‐se IRC agudizada pós‐operatória em 22 (31%) doentes e necessidade de diálise em 5 (7%). A mortalidade global foi 8,5%. Os doentes operados por EVAR tinham DRC mais avançada pré‐operatoriamente, mas apresentaram menor agravamento da função renal. Variação TFG: EVAR 1,14±16,26ml/min vs. CC 9,40±22,11ml/min (p=0,022); variação creatinina: EVAR 0,17±1,03mg/dl vs. CC 0,81±1,47mg/dl (p=0,02). A agudização da IRC pós‐operatória foi superior no grupo CC (53,3 vs. 28,6%; p=0,072), assim como a necessidade de diálise (20 vs. 3,6%, p=0,06). Os 6 doentes que faleceram (EVAR: 3; CC: 3) apresentaram maior agravamento da função renal (variação da creatinina: 1,41±1,63mg/dl vs. 0,20±1,07mg/dl, p=0,001; variação da TFG: −19,0±16,55ml/min; 0,57±17,34ml/min, p=0,007) e necessidade de diálise (50 vs. 3,1%, p=0,003).ConclusãoOs resultados demonstraram uma tendência para uma menor probabilidade de IRA, menor necessidade de diálise pós‐operatória e menor mortalidade nos doentes tratados por EVAR. Contudo, o impacto da administração de contraste a médio/longo prazo, decorrente dos programas de vigilância pós‐EVAR, deve ser considerado.Julgamos ser possível considerar que a realização de EVAR para o tratamento de doentes com AAA e IRC é um procedimento pelo menos tão seguro como a CC.AbstractIntroductionSurgical repair of AAA through EVAR or conventional surgery (CS) can worsen renal function in the short‐term. This complication, more common in patients with CKD, is associated with worse long‐term prognosis. The aim of this study was to quantify the deterioration of renal function after AAA repair in patients with previous IRC and demonstrate the resulting increase in morbidity and mortality.MethodsRetrospective study of patients with CKD stages 3‐4 (eGFR 15‐59mL/min) undergoing elective repair of AAA between February/2011 and February/2015 in a tertiary institution. Studied variables: age, gender, type of intervention (CS/EVAR) and CKD stage. Endpoints: change in creatinine and GFR with surgery, postoperative renal complications, need for another surgical intervention and mortality. Statistical analysis was performed in SPSS.ResultsWe included 71 patients. Fifteen (21%) underwent CS and 56 (78%) EVAR. At the time of intervention, patients had the following stages of CKD: CKD 3 ‐ 65 (91%); CKD 4 ‐ 6 (9%). GFR change with surgery was −1.08±18.01mg/dl. Worsened postoperative IRC occurred in 22 (31%) patients and 5 (7%) needed dialysis. Overall mortality was 8.5%. Patients operated by EVAR had more advanced CKD preoperatively, but showed less worsening of renal function. GFR variation: EVAR 14.1±16.26ml/min vs CS −9.40±22.11ml/min (p=0.022); creatinine variation: EVAR 0.17±1.03mg/dl vs CS 0.81±1.47mg/dl (p=0.02). CKD worsening was superior in the CS group (53.3% vs 28.6%; p=0.072) as well as the need for dialysis (20% vs 3.6%, p=0.06). The 6 patients that died (EVAR: 3; CC: 3) showed greater worsening of renal function (creatinine variation: 1.41±1.63mg/dl vs. 0.20±1.07mg/dl, p=0.001; GFR change: −19.0±16.55ml/min; 0.57±17.34ml/min, p=0.007) and need for dialysis.ConclusionThe results showed a trend towards a lower probability of acute renal failure, less need of post‐operative dialysis and lower mortality in patients treated by EVAR. However, the medium/long term impact of contrast administration, due to post‐EVAR surveillance programs, should be regarded.We believe that it is possible to consider that the use of EVAR for the treatment of patients with AAA and CKD is a procedure at least as safe as CS.",June 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Rodolfo', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Abreu'}, {'given-name': 'João', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Monteiro e Castro'}, {'given-name': 'Frederico', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bastos Gonçalves'}, {'given-name': 'Gonçalo', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Rodrigues'}, {'given-name': 'Anita', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Quintas'}, {'given-name': 'Rita', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ferreira'}, {'given-name': 'Nelson', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Camacho'}, {'given-name': 'Maria Emília', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ferreira'}, {'given-name': 'João', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Albuquerque e Castro'}, {'given-name': 'Luís', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Mota Capitão'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1646706X16000094,1-s2.0-S1646706X16000094
Editor's Choice - External Validation of Models Predicting Survival After Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair,"ObjectivePrediction of survival after intervention for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAA) may support case mix comparison and tailor the prognosis for patients and relatives. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of four prediction models: the updated Glasgow Aneurysm Score (GAS), the Vancouver scoring system, the Edinburgh Ruptured Aneurysm Score (ERAS), and the Hardman index.Design, materials, and methodsThis was a retrospective cohort study in 449 patients in ten hospitals with a RAAA (intervention between 2004 and 2011). The primary endpoint was combined 30 day or in hospital death. The accuracy of the prediction models was assessed for discrimination (area under the curve [AUC]). An AUC &gt;0.70 was considered sufficiently accurate. In studies with sufficiently accurate discrimination, correspondence between the predicted and observed outcomes (i.e. calibration) was recalculated.ResultsThe AUC of the updated GAS was 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66–0.76), of the Vancouver score was 0.72 (95% CI 0.67–0.77), and of the ERAS was 0.58 (95% CI 0.52–0.65). After recalibration, predictions by the updated GAS slightly overestimated the death rate, with a predicted death rate 60% versus observed death rate 54% (95% CI 44–64%). After recalibration, predictions by the Vancouver score considerably overestimated the death rate, with a predicted death rate 82% versus observed death rate 62% (95% CI 52–71%). Performance of the Hardman index could not be assessed on discrimination and calibration, because in 57% of patients electrocardiograms were missing.ConclusionsConcerning discrimination and calibration, the updated GAS most accurately predicted death after intervention for a RAAA. However, the updated GAS did not identify patients with a ≥95% predicted death rate, and therefore cannot reliably support the decision to withhold intervention.",January 2015,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'S.C.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'van Beek'}, {'given-name': 'J.J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Reimerink'}, {'given-name': 'A.C.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Vahl'}, {'given-name': 'W.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Wisselink'}, {'given-name': 'R.J.G.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Peters'}, {'given-name': 'D.A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Legemate'}, {'given-name': 'R.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Balm'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078588414005814,1-s2.0-S1078588414005814

"A simple, effective and clinically applicable method to compute abdominal aortic aneurysm wall stress","AbstractAbdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a permanent and irreversible dilation of the lower region of the aorta. It is a symptomless condition that if left untreated can expand to the point of rupture. Mechanically-speaking, rupture of an artery occurs when the local wall stress exceeds the local wall strength. It is therefore desirable to be able to non-invasively estimate the AAA wall stress for a given patient, quickly and reliably.In this paper we present an entirely new approach to computing the wall tension (i.e. the stress resultant equal to the integral of the stresses tangent to the wall over the wall thickness) within an AAA that relies on trivial linear elastic finite element computations, which can be performed instantaneously in the clinical environment on the simplest computing hardware. As an input to our calculations we only use information readily available in the clinic: the shape of the aneurysm in-vivo, as seen on a computed tomography (CT) scan, and blood pressure. We demonstrate that tension fields computed with the proposed approach agree well with those obtained using very sophisticated, state-of-the-art non-linear inverse procedures. Using magnetic resonance (MR) images of the same patient, we can approximately measure the local wall thickness and calculate the local wall stress. What is truly exciting about this simple approach is that one does not need any information on material parameters; this supports the development and use of patient-specific modelling (PSM), where uncertainty in material data is recognised as a key limitation.The methods demonstrated in this paper are applicable to other areas of biomechanics where the loads and loaded geometry of the system are known.",May 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Grand Roman', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Joldes'}, {'given-name': 'Karol', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Miller'}, {'given-name': 'Adam', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Wittek'}, {'given-name': 'Barry', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Doyle'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1751616115002702,1-s2.0-S1751616115002702
Presenting Baseline Coagulation of Infra Renal Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: A Systematic Review and Pooled Analysis,"BackgroundThe incidence of coagulopathy in patients presenting with rAAA is not clear. The lack of high-quality evidence has led to various speculations, reliance on anecdotal experience, and suggestions about their appropriate haemostatic resuscitation. The aim of this systematic review is to establish the baseline coagulation status of infra renal ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAA) against defined standards and definitions.MethodsAn electronic search of literature in Medline, CINHAL, Scopus Embase, and Cochrane library was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Quality assessment of articles was performed using the Oxford critical appraisal skills programme (CASP) and their recommendation for practice was examined through National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Information on platelet count, international normalisation ratio (INR), activated partial prothrombin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT) fibrinogen and D-dimer was extracted, and pooled analysis was performed in accordance with the definition of coagulopathy and its subtypes. Pooled prevalence of coagulopathies and 95% CI were estimated with a variance weighted random effects model.ResultsSeven studies, comprising 461 patients were included in this systematic review. Overall weighted prevalence of coagulopathy was 12.3% (95% CI 10.7–13.9), 11.7% for INR (95% CI 1–31.6), 10.1% for platelet count (95% CI 1–26.8), and 11.1% for aPTT (95% CI 0.78–31). Fibrinogen serum concentration level was normal in 97%, and 46.2% (n = 55) of patients had elevated D-dimer. Only 6% of the entire population demonstrated significant coagulopathy. DIC was noted in 2.4% of the population.ConclusionThis first systematic review of literature on baseline coagulation of rAAAs suggests that the majority of these patients do not present with coagulopathy and only a minor proportion of patients present with significant coagulopathy.",May 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kordzadeh'}, {'given-name': 'A.D.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Parsa'}, {'given-name': 'A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Askari'}, {'given-name': 'B.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Maddison'}, {'given-name': 'Y.P.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Panayiotopoulos'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078588416001015,1-s2.0-S1078588416001015
Aorta-Iliac Bypass in Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair in Young Chinese Patients,"BackgroundMany surgical methods of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair (TAAAR) have been introduced over the past several decades, with varying degrees of success. We developed an aorta-iliac bypass technique to treat thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) in young Chinese patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the results of this technique intraoperatively and postoperatively.MethodsFrom June 2014 to March 2015, 28 patients underwent TAAAR using aorta-iliac bypass technique. A four-branched tetrafurcate graft was used. Two branches of the graft are sutured to bilateral common iliac arteries in an end-to-side fashion. The trunk of the graft was sutured to the proximal descending aorta in an end-to-end fashion. Then aorta-iliac bypass was established, and the lower extremities, viscera organ and spinal cord (SC) obtained perfusion from proximal descending aorta via the bypass graft. The thoracic and abdominal aorta were clamped in a staged fashion. The patent segmental arteries (SAs), and visceral arteries (coeliac trunk, superior mesenteric arteries, and renal arteries) were reattached sequentially. Evoked potential (EP) monitoring was adopted to assess the SC ischaemia throughout the procedure. The postoperative outcomes and follow-up results of this technique were evaluated.ResultsThere was no in-hospital mortality. Complications included acute kidney dysfunction and pulmonary haemorrhage in one case (3.6%) each. The SAs were reattached in all cases. The EP wave disappeared after proximal descending aorta was clamped, and gradually recovered after the patent SAs reattached. The median follow-up after operation was eight months (range, 1-10 months). There was no delayed neurologic deficit or late death.ConclusionsThoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair using aorta-iliac bypass may be a simple and safe choice for young Chinese patients with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms.",April 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Yu-Yin', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Duan'}, {'given-name': 'Yi-Peng', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ge'}, {'given-name': 'Jun', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Zheng'}, {'given-name': 'Xu-Dong', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Pan'}, {'given-name': 'Xiu-Hua', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Dong'}, {'given-name': 'Wei-Guo', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ma'}, {'given-name': 'Li-Jian', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Cheng'}, {'given-name': 'Jun-Ming', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Zhu'}, {'given-name': 'Yong-Min', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Liu'}, {'given-name': 'Li-Zhong', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sun'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1443950615013852,1-s2.0-S1443950615013852
Estimating the influence of aortic-stent grafts after endovascular aneurysm repair: Are we missing something?,"AbstractThe implantation of a stiff aortic endograft for endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair (EVAR) has been reported to increase aortic stiffness and pulse wave velocity (PWV), raising potential concern over deterioration of myocardial performance. Yet, additional stiffness indices such as the augmentation index (AIx), reflection magnitude (RM) and changes in augmentation pressure (AP) have not been studied adequately to facilitate and improve our knowledge regarding the ways that EVAR affects central hemodynamics. In this article it is suggested that the implantation of an aortic stent-graft exerts its immediate effects not only by interposing extra stiffness on the infrarenal segment but by also modifying the pulse wave reflection site and changing the aortic flow field without necessarily causing significant alterations in PWV. Hence, further studies on myocardial performance in large patient populations are expected to delineate the precise influence of different designs of EVAR endografts on the cardiovascular hemodynamic which, in turn, can affect the morbidity and survival of these patients.",December 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Efstratios', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Georgakarakos'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987716302663,1-s2.0-S0306987716302663

Goal directed fluid therapy reduces major complications in elective surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm: liberal versus restrictive strategies,"AbstractBackgroundOptimal fluid management is crucial for patients undergoing surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Persistent hypovolemia is associated with complications but fluid overload is also harmful.AimThis study evaluates that perioperative fluid restriction would reduce complications and improve outcome through goal-directed strategies in patients undergoing AAA.MethodsFifty patients, aged from 60 to 75years undergoing elective surgical repair of AAA were included in this randomized study. Patients were divided into two groups, 25 for each: liberal group (L) receives 12ml/kg/h and restrictive group (R) receives 4ml/kg/h. Goal-directed-therapy approach was concerning assessment of tissue oxygenation. Dobutamine and fluid challenges were used to maintain adequate tissue perfusion during surgery.ResultsThe patients of the (L) group received a significant greater amount of Lactated Ringer’s solution (3586.76±473.21) than the (R) group (1219±140.6). The (R) group had 50% lower rate of major postoperative complications than the (L) group (24% vs 48%) and less hospital stay.ConclusionA restrictive strategy of fluid maintenance during optimization of oxygen delivery with early treatment directed to maintain oxygen extraction ratio estimate (O2ERe) at &lt;27% reduces major complications and hospital stay of surgical patients undergo abdominal aortic aneurysm.",April 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Dina Y.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kassim'}, {'given-name': 'Ibrahim M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Esmat'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1110184915001282,1-s2.0-S1110184915001282
Positron Emission Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Cellular Inflammation in Patients with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,"ObjectivesInflammation is critical in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease. Combined 18F-fludeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET-CT) and ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide (USPIO)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are non-invasive methods of assessing tissue inflammation. The aim of this study was to compare these techniques in patients with AAA.Materials and methodsFifteen patients with asymptomatic AAA with diameter 46 ± 7 mm underwent PET-CT with 18F-FDG, and T2*-weighted MRI before and 24 hours after administration of USPIO. The PET-CT and MRI data were then co-registered. Standardised uptake values (SUVs) were calculated to measure 18F-FDG activity, and USPIO uptake was determined using the change in R2*. Comparisons between the techniques were made using a quadrant analysis and a voxel-by-voxel evaluation.ResultsWhen all areas of the aneurysm were evaluated, there was a modest correlation between the SUV on PET-CT and the change in R2* on USPIO-enhanced MRI (n = 70,345 voxels; r = .30; p &lt; .0001). Although regions of increased 18F-FDG and USPIO uptake co-localised on occasion, this was infrequent (kappa statistic 0.074; 95% CI 0.026–0.122). 18F-FDG activity was commonly focused in the shoulder region whereas USPIO uptake was more apparent in the main body of the aneurysm. Maximum SUV was lower in patients with mural USPIO uptake.ConclusionsBoth 18F-FDG PET-CT and USPIO-MRI uptake identify vascular inflammation associated with AAA. Although they demonstrate a modest correlation, there are distinct differences in the pattern and distribution of uptake, suggesting a differential detection of macrophage glycolytic and phagocytic activity respectively.",April 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'O.M.B.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'McBride'}, {'given-name': 'N.V.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Joshi'}, {'given-name': 'J.M.J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Robson'}, {'given-name': 'T.J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'MacGillivray'}, {'given-name': 'C.D.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Gray'}, {'given-name': 'A.M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Fletcher'}, {'given-name': 'M.R.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Dweck'}, {'given-name': 'E.J.R.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'van Beek'}, {'given-name': 'J.H.F.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Rudd'}, {'given-name': 'D.E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Newby'}, {'given-name': 'S.I.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Semple'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078588415008928,1-s2.0-S1078588415008928
Rupture of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms in Patients Under Screening Age and Elective Repair Threshold,"ObjectivesThe objective of this study was to identify the proportion of abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures that occur before the screening age or threshold diameter for operative repair is reached.MethodsThe study was a retrospective analysis of RAAA patients including all RAAA patients admitted to Helsinki (HUH) and Tampere University Hospitals (TaUH) during 2002–2013. The data for age, gender, and comorbidities were collected from vascular registry and patient records. Computed tomography images taken at the time of admission were used for the measurement of maximum anteroposterior (AP) aneurysm diameter at the time of rupture. Age and diameter data were compared with risk factors.ResultsA total of 585 patients diagnosed with RAAA were admitted to the two hospitals during the 12 year period. The mean age at the time of rupture was 73.6 years (SD 9.5, range 42–96 years). 18.3% of patients were under 65: 21.4% of men and 3.0% of women. Men were on average 8 years younger than women. The odds ratio (OR) for rupture before 65 years of age for smokers was 2.1 compared with non-smokers, and 28.4% of smokers were under 65 at the time of rupture. Of all RAAA patients, 327 had a computed tomography scan confirming rupture. The mean AP diameter of the aneurysm was 75.6 mm (SD 15.8, range 32–155 mm). The mean size was significantly lower in women than in men (70.5 vs. 76.8, p = .005).ConclusionsThe data from this study show that a fifth of men would not make it to the screening age of 65 before AAA rupture, the proportion being even larger in active smokers. The data from this study also supports the previous finding that aneurysm size at the time of rupture is significantly smaller in women.",April 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'M.T.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Laine'}, {'given-name': 'T.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Vänttinen'}, {'given-name': 'I.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kantonen'}, {'given-name': 'K.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Halmesmäki'}, {'given-name': 'E.M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Weselius'}, {'given-name': 'S.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Laukontaus'}, {'given-name': 'J.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Salenius'}, {'given-name': 'P.S.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Aho'}, {'given-name': 'M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Venermo'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078588415008850,1-s2.0-S1078588415008850
Contrast inhomogeneity in CT angiography of the abdominal aortic aneurysm,"AbstractBackgroundIf undetected, infrarenal Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) growth can lead to rupture, a high-mortality complication. Some AAA patients exhibit inhomogeneous luminal contrast attenuation at first-pass CT angiography (CTA). This study assesses the association between this observation and aneurysm growth.MethodsSixty-seven consecutive pre-repair AAA CTAs were included in this retrospective study. The “Gravitational Gradient” (GG), defined as the ratio of the mean attenuation in a region-of-interest placed posteriorly to that in a region-of-interest placed anteriorly within the lumen of the aortic aneurysm on a single axial slice, and the maximum aneurysm diameter were measured from each CT data set. “AAA Contrast Inhomogeneity” was defined as the absolute value of the difference between the GG and 1.0. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association of aneurysm growth &gt;0.4 and &gt;1.0 cm/year to AAA Contrast Inhomogeneity, aneurysm diameter, patient characteristics and cardiovascular co-morbidities.ResultsAAA Contrast Inhomogeneity was not correlated to aneurysm diameter (p = 0.325). In multivariable analysis that included initial aneurysm diameter and AAA Contrast Inhomogeneity, both factors were significantly associated with rapid aneurysm growth (initial diameter: p = 0.029 and 0.011, and, AAA Contrast Inhomogeneity: p = 0.045 and 0.048 for growth &gt;0.4 cm/year and &gt;1 cm/year respectively).ConclusionsAAA Contrast Inhomogeneity is a common observation in first-pass CTA.

Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: Prediction of Mortality From Clinical Presentation and Glasgow Aneurysm Score,"ObjectiveTo examine association of presenting clinical acuity and Glasgow Aneurysm Score (GAS) with perioperative and 1-year mortality.DesignRetrospective chart review.SettingMajor tertiary care facility.ParticipantsPatients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) from 2003 through 2013.InterventionsEmergency repair of rAAA.Measurements and Main ResultsThe authors reviewed outcomes after stable versus unstable presentation and by GAS. Unstable presentation included hypotension, cardiac arrest, loss of consciousness, and preoperative tracheal intubation. In total, 125 patients (40 stable) underwent repair. Perioperative mortality rates were 41% and 12% in unstable and stable patients, respectively (p&lt;0.001). Unstable status had 88% sensitivity and 41% specificity for predicting perioperative mortality. Using logistic regression, higher GAS was associated with perioperative mortality (p&lt;0.001). Using receiver operating characteristic analysis, the area under the curve was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.62-0.82) and cutoff GAS≥96 had 63% and 72% sensitivity and specificity, respectively. Perioperative mortality for GAS≥96 was 51% (25/49), whereas it was 20% (15/76) for GAS≤95. The estimated 1-year survival (95% CI) was 75% (62%-91%) for stable patients and 48% (38%-60%) for unstable patients. Estimated 1-year survival (95% CI) was 23% (13%-40%) for GAS≥96 and 77% (67%-87%) for GAS≤95.ConclusionsClinical presentation and GAS identified patients with rAAA who were likely to have a poor surgical outcome. GAS≥96 was associated with poor long-term survival, but&gt;20% of these patients survived 1 year. Thus, neither clinical presentation nor GAS provided reliable guidance for decisions regarding futility of surgery.",April 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Toby N.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Weingarten'}, {'given-name': 'Lauren T.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Thompson'}, {'given-name': 'Lauren K.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Licatino'}, {'given-name': 'Christopher H.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bailey'}, {'given-name': 'Darrell R.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Schroeder'}, {'given-name': 'Juraj', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sprung'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053077015009271,1-s2.0-S1053077015009271
"Abdominal aortic aneurysm and histological, clinical, radiological correlation","AbstractTo date, the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurism (AAA) still remains unclear. As such, the aim of this study was to evaluate changes of the aortic structure during AAA. We analysed the microscopic frame of vessels sections, starting from the primum movens leading to abnormal dilatation. AAA samples were collected and processed through various staining methods (Verhoeff-Van Gieson, Masson Goldner, Sirius Red). Subsequently, the vessel morphology and collagenic web of the tunica media and adventitia were determined and the amount of type I and type III collagen was measured. We also applied immune-histochemistry markers for CD34 and PGP 9.5 in order to identify vascular and nerve structures in the aorta. Immune-positivity quantification was used to calculate the percentage of the stained area. We found increasing deposition of type I collagen and reduced type III collagen in both tunica media and adventitia of AAA. The total amount of vasa vasorum, marked with CD34, and nerva vasorum, marked with PGP 9.5, was also higher in AAA samples. Cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, dyslipidemia, cigarette smoking) and radiological data (maximum aneurism diameter, intra-luminal thrombus, aortic wall calcification) increased these changes. These results suggest that the tunica adventitia may have a central role in the pathogenesis of AAA as clearly there are major changes characterized by rooted inflammatory infiltration. The presence of immune components could explain these modifications within the framework of the aorta.",April 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Luigi Fabrizio', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Rodella'}, {'given-name': 'Rita', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Rezzani'}, {'given-name': 'Francesca', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bonomini'}, {'given-name': 'Michele', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Peroni'}, {'given-name': 'Marco Angelo', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Cocchi'}, {'given-name': 'Lena', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Hirtler'}, {'given-name': 'Stefano', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Bonardelli'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065128116300071,1-s2.0-S0065128116300071
Abdominal aortic aneurysms – glycaemic status and mortality,"AbstractAimsThe prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and mortality with respect to glycaemic status in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) was evaluated. Glycaemic status was assessed by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and by HbA1c.MethodsSixty-six patients with AAA admitted to the vascular surgery unit for elective surgery between October 2006 and September 2007 were included. Seven patients had previously known DM. OGTT and HbA1c results were available from 58 patients. The patients were categorized as having DM, prediabetes and normoglycaemia according to the WHO's and American Diabetes Association's criteria.ResultsThe prevalence of newly diagnosed DM according to the OGTT and HbA1c results were 12% and 14% respectively. Mean follow-up time was 68months and all-cause mortality 43%. HbA1c was an independent predictor for mortality in the DM category. Hazard ratio of all-cause mortality in the DM category defined by the HbA1c values was 6.35, 95% [CI 1.49–27.1]; p = 0.01.ConclusionsDM defined by HbA1c≥6.5% is an important determinant of mortality following surgical treatment for AAA.

Aortic Neck Anatomic Features and Predictors of Outcomes in Endovascular Repair of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Following vs Not Following Instructions for Use,"BackgroundA significant number of patients undergo endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR) outside the instructions for use (IFU). This study will examine various aortic neck features and their predictors of clinical outcomes.Study DesignWe performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on EVAR patients. Neck features outside IFU were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier and multivariate analyses were used to predict their effect as single features, or in combination, on outcomes.ResultsFifty-two percent of 526 patients had 1 or more features outside the IFU. The overall technical success rate was 99%, and perioperative complication rates were 7% and 12% for IFU vs outside IFU use, respectively (p = 0.04). Type I early endoleak and early intervention rates were 7% and 10% for IFU vs 18% and 24% for outside IFU (p = 0.0002 and p &lt; 0.0001). At a mean follow-up of 30 months, freedom from late type I endoleak and late reintervention at 1, 2, and 3 years for IFU were 99.5%, 99.5%, and 98.4%, and 99.4%, 98%, and 96.8%; vs 98.9%, 98.1%, and 98.1%, and 97.5%, 96.2%, and 95.2% for outside IFU (p = 0.049 and 0.799), respectively.

A multi-locus genetic risk score for abdominal aortic aneurysm,"AbstractBackgroundWe investigated whether a multi-locus genetic risk scores (GRS) was associated with presence and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in a case - control study.Methods and ResultsThe study comprised of 1124 patients with AAA (74 ± 8 years, 83% men, 52% of them with a maximal AAA size ≤ 5 cm) and 6524 non-cases (67 ± 11 years, 58% men) from the Mayo Vascular Disease Biorepository. AAA was defined as infrarenal abdominal aorta diameter ≥3.0 cm or history of AAA repair. Non-cases were participants without known AAA. A GRS was calculated using 4 SNPs associated with AAA at genome-wide significance (P ≤ 10−8). The GRS was associated with the presence of AAA after adjustment for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases and family history of aortic aneurysm: odds ratio (OR, 95% confidence interval, CI) 1.06 (1.04–1.09, p &lt; 0.001). Adding GRS to conventional risk factors improved the association of presence of AAA (net reclassification index 14%, p &lt; 0.001). In a subset of patients with AAA who had ≥2 imaging studies (n = 651, mean (SE) growth rate 2.47 (0.11) mm/year during a mean time interval of 5.41years), GRS, baseline size, diabetes and family history were each associated with aneurysm growth rate in univariate association (all p &lt; 0.05).

Temporary Abdominal Closure After Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair: A Systematic Review of Contemporary Observational Studies,"ObjectivesThe aim of this paper was to review the literature on temporary abdominal closure (TAC) after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.MethodsThis was a systematic review of observational studies. A PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane search from 2007 to July 2015 was performed combining the Medical Subject Headings “aortic aneurysm” and “temporary abdominal closure”, “delayed abdominal closure”, “open abdomen”, “abdominal compartment syndrome”, “negative pressure wound therapy”, or “vacuum assisted wound closure”.ResultsSeven original studies were found. The methods used for TAC were the vacuum pack system with (n = 1) or without (n = 2) mesh bridge, vacuum assisted wound closure (VAWC; n = 1) and the VAWC with mesh mediated fascial traction (VACM; n = 3). The number of patients included varied from four to 30. Three studies were exclusively after open repair, one after endovascular aneurysm repair, and three were mixed series. The frequency of ruptured AAA varied from 60% to 100%. The primary fascial closure rate varied from 79% to 100%. The median time to closure of the open abdomen was 10.5 and 17 days in two prospective studies with a fascial closure rate of 100% and 96%, respectively; the inclusion criterion was an anticipated open abdomen therapy time ≥5 days using the VACM method. The graft infection rate was 0% in three studies. No patient with long-term open abdomen therapy with the VACM in the three studies was left with a planned ventral hernia. The in hospital survival rate varied from 46% to 80%.ConclusionsA high fascial closure rate without planned ventral hernia is possible to achieve with VACM, even after long-term open abdomen therapy. There are, however, few publications reporting specific results of open abdomen treatment after AAA repair, and there is a need for randomized controlled trials to determine the most efficient and safe TAC method during open abdomen treatment after AAA repair.",March 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'S.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Acosta'}, {'given-name': 'A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Wanhainen'}, {'given-name': 'M.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Björck'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078588415007637,1-s2.0-S1078588415007637

Simultaneous endovascular repairs of concomitant ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and huge silent thoracic aortic aneurysm,"AbstractRuptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) is an emergent condition that carries higher mortality rate. Although there had been development of interventional and surgical technique besides improved critical care, mortality rates were still varied between 35 and 53% in the reported series. Preoperative shock was reported as a major factor predicting mortality rate. Feasibility of simultaneous endovascular repair of rAAA and silent thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is not known. Herein, we aimed to demonstrate the advantage of simultaneous endovascular repair of rAAA and silent TAA in the settling of hemodynamic and neurologic instability. We proposed that simultaneous repair of silent aneurysm would eliminate second procedural risk and also further rupture risk, especially in high-risk patients.",September 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Ahmet', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Karabulut'}, {'given-name': 'Selim', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Aydın'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019483216301250,1-s2.0-S0019483216301250
MicroRNA-145 Mediates the Formation of Angiotensin II-Induced Murine Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,"AbstractBackgroundMicroRNA-145 (miR-145) has been implicated in vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully understood, especially their role in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) expansion. Here, we sought to explore and define the mechanisms of miR-145 function in the experimental AAA models in AngII-infused ApoE−/− mice.MethodsmiR-145 was overexpressed in ApoE−/− mice via lentivirus infection, and then the incidence of AAA, maximum abdominal aortic diameter, elastin degradation and MMP2 activation were determined in AngII-infused ApoE−/− mice.ResultsIn vivo overexpression of miR-145 by lentivirus infection greatly decreased the incidence of AAA, maximum abdominal aortic diameter, and elastin degradation, accompanied with downregulation of MMP2 activation in AngII-infused ApoE−/− mice. Cell culture assays indicated that miR-145 inhibited AngII-induced upregulation of MMP2 gene expression. In contrast, deficiency of MMP2 abolished the effects of miR-145 on AngII-induced elastin and collagens degradations in ApoE-/− mice.ConclusionThese data suggest that regulation of expression of miR-145 may be a potential therapeutic option for vascular disease progression such as AAA expansion.",Available online 24 November 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Jing', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Wu'}, {'given-name': 'Jun', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Wang'}, {'given-name': 'Xiaoou', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Li'}, {'given-name': 'Xiaofeng', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Liu'}, {'given-name': 'Xiuyan', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Yu'}, {'given-name': 'Yunling', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Tian'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1443950616316687,1-s2.0-S1443950616316687
Evidence of deregulated cholesterol efflux in abdominal aortic aneurysm,"AbstractPrevious studies indicated that lipids may be associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA); however the molecular mechanism involved is unclear. Our study aimed to investigate the expression pattern of cholesterol efflux related proteins in AAA. Liver X receptors (LXRα and LXRβ), ATP-binding-cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), Apolipoprotein AI (ApoAI), smooth muscle α-actin (α-SM) and vimentin expression levels were evaluated in human AAA, atherosclerotic (ATH) and normal abdominal aortic tissues. We found significant differences in LXRα, LXRβ and ABCA1 mRNA expression levels between AAA, ATH and normal whole aortic tissues and also within the AAA, ATH and normal “intima-media” layers. Specifically, LXRα, LXRβ and ABCA1 mRNA levels were decreased in AAA compared to ATH-whole tissues, as well as in AAA “intima-media” compared to ATH and normal “intima-media” layers. Moreover, immunohistochemical evaluation revealed that LXRα and ABCA1 immunoreactivities (IR) were reduced in the AAA media compared to the normal and ATH media layers and that they were also reduced in the intima layer of AAA and ATH tissues, whereas ApoAI-IR was increased in the AAA and ATH aortic walls compared to normal pointing to possible deregulation of the cholesterol efflux mechanism in AAA. Furthermore, double staining for vimentin and α-SM showed vimentin expression in the intima and inner media layer of AAA with sparse vimentin positive SMCs designating possible SMCs phenotype switch from contractile to synthetic form. In addition, histochemical analysis showed excessive lipid accumulation in the AAA wall, while co-staining using Oil Red O with α-SM or CD68 revealed lipid accumulation in SMCs and macrophages, respectively. Our study provides novel evidence for impaired cholesterol efflux in AAA associated with lipid accumulation in SMCs and macrophages, as well as switch of SMCs phenotype from contractile to synthetic form.",March 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Evanthia', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Mourmoura'}, {'given-name': 'Anna', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Vasilaki'}, {'given-name': 'Athanasios', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Giannoukas'}, {'given-name': 'Emmanouel', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Michalodimitrakis'}, {'given-name': 'Pavlos', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Pavlidis'}, {'given-name': 'Aspasia', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Tsezou'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065128115300295,1-s2.0-S0065128115300295
Plasma microRNAs serve as potential biomarkers for abdominal aortic aneurysm,"AbstractObjectivesAbdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is often asymptomatic until rupture occurs. Although ultrasound screening has significantly improved the early diagnosis of AAA, the timely biomarker-based diagnosis of AAA remains a major clinical challenge. In this study, we aimed to assess plasma microRNAs (miRNAs) as promising novel biomarkers in patients with AAA.MethodsPooled plasma samples from 10 AAA and 10 healthy controls were profiled by microarray. The differentially expressed miRNAs were evaluated in a separate cohort of 120 subjects, including 60 AAA patients and 60 normal controls.ResultsThe initial profiling study identified 151 miRNAs that showed more than two-fold change. Among them, three miRNAs, miR-191-3p, miR-455-3p and miR-1281 exhibited the largest increase in the patient group (fold change &gt;5). A subsequent validation study confirmed the elevation of these three miRNAs. Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis using the expression ratio of miR-191-3p, miR-455-3p and miR-1281 showed an area under the curve of 0.9700, 0.9825 and 0.9206, respectively.ConclusionOur results suggest that plasma miR-191-3p, miR-455-3p and miR-1281 may be used as potential diagnosis biomarkers for AAA.",October 2015,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Wenwen', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Zhang'}, {'given-name': 'Tao', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Shang'}, {'given-name': 'Chen', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Huang'}, {'given-name': 'Tong', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Yu'}, {'given-name': 'Chen', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Liu'}, {'given-name': 'Tong', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Qiao'}, {'given-name': 'Dian', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Huang'}, {'given-name': 'Zhao', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Liu'}, {'given-name': 'Changjian', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Liu'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S000991201500140X,1-s2.0-S000991201500140X

Copresence of abdominal aortic aneurysm in symptomatic coronary artery disease patients,"AbstractBackground/aimsPrevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has ethnic difference, and is more in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. No Indian data are available on this. We aim to know the prevalence of AAA in symptomatic CAD patients in ≥40 years age group and compare it with the general population in North Western India.Methods200 angiographically proven symptomatic CAD patients (88.5% men, mean age 57.54±9.96 years) and 200 age- and sex-matched healthy people (81.9% males, mean age 57.16±10.05 years), ≥40 years age, were screened for AAA by 2D echo study. CT aortography was done for confirmation in positive cases.ResultsAAA was present in 3.5% of CAD patients and 1% of age- and sex-matched healthy people ≥40 years. AAA was present in 7.4% of triple vessel disease (TVD) patients, 2.6% of double vessel disease (DVD) patients, and 1.4% of single vessel disease (SVD) patients. CAD patients presented with AAA at mean age of 67.8±4.70 years. The youngest patient with AAA in CAD group was of 58 years.ConclusionsIn North Western India, the prevalence of AAA is lesser, both in CAD group and in controls, as compared to western countries. Prevalence of AAA increases with increasing severity of CAD; hence AAA should be screened, particularly in TVD patients. CAD patients may be considered for earlier screening for AAA than the general population.",March 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Gaurav', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Khandelwal'}, {'given-name': 'Anoop', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Jain'}, {'given-name': 'Monika', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Rathore'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1561881116300116,1-s2.0-S1561881116300116

High Resolution Strain Analysis Comparing Aorta and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm with Real Time Three Dimensional Speckle Tracking Ultrasound,"Objective/BackgroundUltrasound measurement of aortic diameter for aneurysm screening allows supervision of aneurysm growth. Additional biomechanical analysis of wall motion and aneurysm deformation can supply information about individual elastic properties and the pathological state of the aortic wall. Local aortic wall motion was analyzed through imaged aortic segments according to age and pathology.MethodsSixty-five patients were examined with a commercial four dimensional ultrasound system (4D-US). Three groups were defined: patients with normal aortic diameter and younger than 60 years of age (n = 21); those with normal aortic diameter and older than 60 years of age (n = 25); and those with infrarenal aortic aneurysm (n = 19). A diastolic reference shape of aortic wall segments was obtained and local and temporally resolved wall strain was determined. Indices characterizing the resulting wall strain distribution were determined.ResultsThe analysis of biomechanical properties displayed increasing heterogeneous and dyssynchronous circumferential strain with increasing patient age. Young patients exhibited higher mean strain amplitude. The distribution of the spatial heterogeneity index and local strain ratio was inversely proportional to age. The maximum local strain amplitude was significantly higher in the young (0.26 ± 0.17) compared with the old (0.16 ± 0.07) or aneurysmal aorta (0.16 ± 0.10). Temporal dyssynchrony significantly differed between young (0.13 ± 0.10) and old (aneurysmal 0.31 ± 0.04, non-aneurysmal 0.29 ± 0.05), regardless of aortic diameter. The spatial heterogeneity index and local strain ratio differentiate non-aneurysmal and aneurysmal aorta, regardless of age.Conclusions4D-US strain imaging enables description of individual wall motion (kinematics) of the infrarenal aorta with high spatial and temporal resolution. Functional differences between young, old, and aneurysmal aorta can be described by mean (circumferential) strain amplitude, the spatial heterogeneity index, and the local strain ratio.

Trends in Abdominal Aortic and Iliac Aneurysm Repairs in Norway from 2001 to 2013,"Objective/backgroundThe objective was to examine trends in abdominal aortic and iliac aneurysm repairs in Norway from 2001 to 2013, and study regional variations and organizational developments in this type of vascular surgery.MethodsThis was a retrospective study on aortic and iliac aneurysm repairs using data from the Norwegian Patient Register. The vascular centers were categorized by yearly volume of repairs into small (&lt;18), medium (18–49) and large (≥50). Incidence rates were assessed per 100,000 ≥ 60 years. The percentage of endovascular aneurysm repairs (EVAR) was calculated among the conducted repairs at the three categories of centers and the South-Eastern, Western, Central, and Northern Norway Regional Health Authority (NRHA).ResultsThe national incidence rates of intact repairs per 100,000 ≥ 60 years increased from 57.4 to 65.7 (p &lt; .01). Ruptured repairs decreased from 19.7 to 9.2 (p &lt; .01). The rate of EVAR increased from 6.0 to 29.9 (p &lt; .01) in intact and from 0.4 to 2.5 (p &lt; .01) in ruptured repairs. The vascular centers were reduced from 25 to 16. The rate of EVAR was 27.1% (p &lt; .01) higher at large centers and 7.9% (p &lt; .03) higher at medium centers compared with small centers, and from 11.1% to 15.7% higher (p &lt; .01) at the Central, Western, and Northern NRHA compared with the South-Eastern NRHA, which had the most centers (also in the large category). The national increase in intact EVAR from 10.6% to 43.3% was less compared with many other Western countries.ConclusionDuring the study period the rates of intact repairs increased while the ruptured repairs decreased. EVAR was associated with centers performing high volumes of abdominal aortic and iliac aneurysm repairs and regional authorities organized with few centers.",February 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'K.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Wendt'}, {'given-name': 'R.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kristiansen'}, {'given-name': 'K.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Krohg-Sørensen'}, {'given-name': 'F.A.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Gregersen'}, {'given-name': 'E.', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Fosse'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078588415006267,1-s2.0-S1078588415006267

A case of acute ischemic colitis after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair,"AbstractColonic ischemia is a recognized complication of either open or endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The clinical difficulty in establishing the diagnosis, the severity of this complication and the patient's poor physiological status may lead to a fatal outcome. We presented a case of ischemic colitis in a patient with patent hypogastric arteries that occurred after an endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair as well as a review of the available literature. The patient's preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data were recorded. A thorough search through the Google data and Medline to review similar cases or any analyses that referred to ischemic colitis after endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair was conducted. A 76-year-old male was admitted to our department for an elective endovascular repair of an 8 cm in diameter abdominal aortic aneurysm. A Zenith bifurcation graft was implanted. The whole procedure was uneventful and the final angiogram showed an accurate deployment of the endograft without endoleaks and patency of both hypogastric arteries. During the 1st postoperative day, the patient developed symptoms of acute abdomen in combination with metabolic acidosis and oliguria. He underwent an exploratory laparotomy, which revealed necrosis of the sigmoid. A Hartmann's procedure was performed; the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit where he deceased after 24 h. Postoperative ischemic colitis has been described after open abdominal aneurysm repair. The description of this complication has been reported since the early phase of endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair development with a current incidence of 1.5%–3.0%.

A idade e o tratamento endovascular do aneurisma da aorta abdominal. Estado da arte,"ResumoDesde a primeira publicação da realização de tratamento endovascular do aneurisma da aorta abdominal (EVAR), por Juan Parodi, em 1991, que este tem sido consensualmente aplicado em doentes de risco cirúrgico elevado e em doentes de idade mais avançada. A grande maioria dos estudos descreve uma menor mortalidade precoce, um menor tempo de internamento, um menor consumo de derivados de sangue e uma melhor qualidade de vida após o EVAR. Assim, urge saber a durabilidade do procedimento, a taxa de reintervenções e a probabilidade de rotura aneurismática do EVAR em doentes jovens, e se a idade é ou não um fator importante de decisão terapêutica no tratamento dos aneurismas da aorta abdominal. Esta revisão propõe‐se a responder a esta questão, reunindo para isso a informação dos estudos mais recentes e relevantes em relação a este tema.AbstractSince Parodi's publication in 1991 about first EVAR, this therapy has been widely used in elderly and high risk patients. Several randomized controlled trials showed less 30‐day mortality, shorter length of stay, lower consumption of blood products and better short‐term quality of live with EVAR. When it comes to younger patients, it is imperative to question about procedure durability, reintervention rates and probability of aneurysmal sac growth and rupture, and if age is a determinant factor in EVAR choice. This review aims to answer this question, gathering the information of the most recent and relevant studies regarding this issue.",March 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Rui', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Machado'}, {'given-name': 'Gabriela', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Teixeira'}, {'given-name': 'Luís', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Loureiro'}, {'given-name': 'Pedro', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Oliveira'}, {'given-name': 'Rui', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Almeida'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1646706X1500141X,1-s2.0-S1646706X1500141X
"Suppression of abdominal aortic aneurysm formation by AR-R17779, an agonist for the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor","AbstractObjectiveActivation of vagal nerve suppresses inflammatory responses through activation of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR). We sought to determine whether AR-R17779, a selective agonist of α7nAchR, affects the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).Methods and resultsAAA was induced by topical application of calcium chloride (CaCl2) to abdominal aorta (AAA group). NaCl (0.9%) was substituted for CaCl2 as a sham operation (SHAM group). AR-R17779 was administered in drinking water (AAA/AR-R group). One and 6 weeks after the operation, aortic tissue was excised for histological and molecular analyses. Aortic diameter and macrophage infiltration into the aortic adventitia were increased in AAA group compared with SHAM group at 6 weeks. Treatment with AR-R17779 reduced the diameter of the aorta and macrophage infiltration compared with AAA group. Wavy morphology of the elastic lamellae was lost in AAA group while it was preserved in AAA/AR-R group. Expression of inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activities were enhanced in AAA group, which was suppressed in AAA/AR-R group. AR-R17779 treatment suppressed CaCl2-induced expression of cytokines, activities of MMPs and NF-κB activation at 1 week when aortic dilatation had not developed.ConclusionTreatment with AR-R17779 prevented the enlargement of abdominal aorta induced by CaCl2 in association with reduced inflammation and extracellular matrix disruption. These findings suggest therapeutic potential of α7nAchR activation for prevention of AAA development.",January 2016,"{'author': [{'given-name': 'Aya', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Watanabe'}, {'given-name': 'Toshihiro', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ichiki'}, {'given-name': 'Hiroshi', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kojima'}, {'given-name': 'Yusuke', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Takahara'}, {'given-name': 'Eva', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Hurt-Camejo'}, {'given-name': 'Erik', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Michaëlsson'}, {'given-name': 'Chikahiro', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sankoda'}, {'given-name': 'Jiro', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Ikeda'}, {'given-name': 'Eriko', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Inoue'}, {'given-name': 'Tomotake', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Tokunou'}, {'given-name': 'Shiro', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Kitamoto'}, {'given-name': 'Kenji', '@_fa': 'true', 'surname': 'Sunagawa'}]}",http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021915015302021,1-s2.0-S0021915015302021
